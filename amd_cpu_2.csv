			No way. Custom loop maybe but no AIO will cool better than the setup I have...Thermalright Silver Arrow TR4 with dual 140mm Noctua Chromax fans running full speed.  During video encoding with Vidcoder, every core of the 1950X is pushing about 100%.  Maybe in less cpu intensive tasks.  I have experimented with the volts for a long time and cannot push more than 1.24 (1.23750) volts without temps passing 68C.  Pushing the 1950X past 3.7Ghz at this voltage results in an unstable overclock, not even 3.8Ghz.  I originally started with the Enermax Liqtech TR4 360.  Total garbage...Went through two and both leaked and didn't cool better than my setup now even before they weren't leaking.  I've seen people boast 3.9-4.1Ghz overclocks online.  I don't know what applications they are using but the way Vidcoder pushes every core of the 1950X, averaging 230 watts can't keep the temps lower than 68C.  Even with my current overclock the temps get up to 71C when the ambient room temp is warm.

			Hey all, i had to join this forum just so i could take part in this discussion, and hopefully get some help from you guys as you certainly know more about this than me!



My intel says went tits up last week.  I had to scramble to build a new system as its a workstation, and i didnt want to be down to long, potentially turning away work.  After all the good things i heard about the new Ryzen stuff, i decided to go AMD this time.  I ended up with a similar setup to GoldChain...



3950x

MSI MEG ACE

G.Skill Ripjaws V Series F4-3200C16Q-64GVK



Iv only had the system running for 2 days.  I had a bunch of issues getting my 3 gpus to show up in windows, and realized the m2 drive in slot 1 was the problem.  I can get 3 gpus with an m2 in slot 2, but not an m2 in slot 2 and 3... i guess im at the lanes limit there as the 3rd GPU disappears from windows.  For now, since this board only offers a measly 4 sata ports, i opted to remove 1 GPU so i could run the 2 m2 drives instead.   Once i finally got things working, and started setting up windows, i noticed the idle temp was rather high, averaging in the high 40s.  I googled and that lead me here to this thread.



My previous system was an i7 5960x.  It OC'd realy well, but ill admit im pretty dumb when it comes to OCing.  I was handheld by a more season Asus user for the most part, and he helped me dial it in, showed me what to change, etc.  So here I am now, being forced into AMD land, and i have no idea what alot of this stuff is.



Goldchain says hes doing his adjustments in BIOS, and thats how i prefer to work as well.  I did poke around in there briefly after looking thru this thread, and i did do 1 adjustment by using the Offset Voltage mode to reduce the voltage by 0.2.  That definitely helped with the temps, and right now, HWInfo is telling me im in the mid 30s.  Iv only barely started to install apps and what not, so i havent put the system under any kind of stress testing yet, but before i start doing that, i was hoping you guys could help me get things set up to where they should be, as reading not only here, but elsewhere, that MOST of the bios settings are way off from where they should be.



I see a couple screenshots of RM above, and looking at them, i see alot of values that look like some of the terms i remember seeing in the bios.  Is it possible to take one of those screenshots and just transpose those values into my own bios?  Is everything labelled the same?  Im sure i wouldnt shoot for the moon right off the bat though.  Actually my intent for this system wasnt to overclock it since iv read there isnt much headroom in these CPUS as it is.  I think if i was able to hit 4.3 id be very happy, but if i was using anything above as a guide, i would work my way up to that.



Either way,  since this is Goldchains thread, and he had realy good results, im hoping he can help me out and give me some pointers here, but im open to suggestions from everyone!  But remember, this is all new to me, so im sure ill need a bit of hand holding to work my way thru it.



Thanks in advance!  Looking forward to taming this board a bit!

the bios settings may be labeled differently but you should be able to infer what is what. re overclocking, just turn on PBO and call it a day, especially since you said its a workstation you rely on for work. and make sure you run some stress tests before using it for whatever work it is."

			It's  a performance jump for sure, and sounds like you'll have zero problems affording it.  Issues?  Well, it's a lot more difficult to cool the 3950X vs dual Xeons.  Again, I can't see that being a problem for you.  Memory and motherboard selection always seem to be an issue.  You'll have to do your own research (I'm sure many here could make recommendations).

The 3950x, thanks to better binning, runs cooler than a 3900x in most any situation and I have no problems cooling my 3900x. Unless your goal is to keep it under 70C while doing an AVX2 stress test, cooling isn't really an issue. Since overclocking really isn't a thing with these CPU's, just slap on a good AIO, get over the cooling OCD and be done with it."

Messing around yesterday, either my chip is a complete dog or I'm really screwing things up.  I tried some overclocking with Ryzen Master.  I couldn't complete a CB20 run at 4.3 all core at even 1.3875v.  I dialed things back to 1.35, and clocked the chiplets separately.  The best I could do was 4.35 GHz on the good chiplet and 4.25 GHz on the bad chiplet.  Anything higher will not finish a CB20 run.  I then ran Prime 95 at those settings and the computer rebooted after about 5 minutes.  Also, temps are completely fine at all of these settings.  Never out of the 60s.  What am I doing wrong?"

			This is what I've seen online with some of the benchmarks.  I do not game, but rather use my build almost exclusively for handbrake encoding.  Handbrake likes and uses multi-threaded processors, hence why threadripper exceeds at this.  I use extremely high encoding settings and I am going to be increasing 4K encoding where with the 1950X I average 2.5 - 4 FPS, which is tediously slow.  If I were to consider building a 3950X rig, I would have to see percentage wise how much faster Handbrake performance I could get to justify the expense.
		
		Click to expand...
	
In multi-threaded applications the increase in performance will be there. I'm not sure that it would justify the cost as you'd need to change your motherboard, CPU and cooling solution just to make the switch. It would likely cost you more than a $1,000 to change everything over. I'm absolutely certain the 3950X will be faster, but by how much, I can't say in that specific application."

			Perhaps I should mention the reason for focusing on the cooling of the new build.  About 18 years ago I accidentally destroyed an Athlon XP 2000+ cpu.  It overheated and melted.  Was not my fault, the PC builder did not install in a case with proper ventilation.  Ever since then I carefully watch temps in my systems to ensure they are not damaged by heat.  The whole tech industry is probably a lot better at avoiding catastrophes like today, I think the industry was still coming to grips with the consequences of greater amounts of heat coming from chips back in those days.

Chips now are so intelligent. They will not melt. They will literally pull all their voltage and frequency if overheated and they will rapidly self cool or completely shut down their cores in order to prevent 20 years ago from happening."

			This does not appear to be the case with the OP. He will be happy if it's under 85C and he's also sure it won't cool as well as his H115i which means his current cooler is already capable of keeping it under 85C which is all he's expecting from the air cooler. Which brings me to my question, what am I missing?



BTW, an h60 is about the lowest end of water cooling.

Also, as a fellow plex user, I'm also planning on a 3900X to help with real time transcoding. So I get that. Can't wait to upgrade myself.   Little envious.



That said, I've never had a motherboard fail on me,so part of that is luck of the draw.  The shit that I put my Phenom II motherboard through kinda mindboggles me that it's still alive and kicking somehow.

			So this is something I'm trying to figure out as well with my 3960x as it idles in the 50's as well.  I suspected that my 128 GB's of memory overclock and tighter timings was the culprit, but I'm leaning way over to needing a better cooling solution.  I spent the day running cinebench R20 at different memory clock speeds from 2933 up to the highest stable clock I've managed at 3400 with 14-15-15-15-30 timings.  The memory settings made no difference on my idle temps as they stuck around 53 degrees through all the tests.  What's more, all those settings didn't change my score which stayed just above 13400 the whole time (and that's strange to me as I thought the chip infinity fabric would play a bigger role in that test).  So I have to rule my memory timings out as a cause... and that needle is pointing more to my cooling solution, a castle 360ex AIO.  Just to make sure, I fiddled with CPU core and SOC voltages, trimming them down with still no changes to my idle temps.  Then I took a closer look at what ryzen master was showing, and like your situation all the cores were just jumping around staying busy, so started closing background tasks... and after closing Corsair's iCUE, temp drop 5% right there and the CPU was a lot less active at idle.  I run a rainmeter display as well, and when I shut down that and the HWinfo app feeding the data, dropped another 3%.  So, while taking out some background tasks help, I still have a cooling problem if those minor tasks caused an almost 10% jump in temps.  Running those cinebench R20 benchmarks, I was maxing out at 83 degrees which is still too high for me.  I'm going to reapply the thermal paste although I doubt that's the problem.



The website does indicate a max temp of 68 degrees C, but I have to wonder if that's the same temp measure/sensor used by Ryzen Master, as the temp meter in there doesn't turn yellow until 80 degrees and not red until like 90 degrees, and it also indicates a maximum of 95 degrees... at which time I think the chip throttles.

I don't have a threadripper, but the temps your talking about mimic pretty closely to the desktop variants."

So I am very confused in terms of a ""Safe"" all core voltage for my 3900x. Quick look to Google suggests 1.325 has been reported by AMD as a ""Safe"" but I cannot find this on any AMD articles or really any kind of review / overclock review. So I am hoping some of the more in the know folks here would have a better idea of where I can lock this in at. 



That being said I feel like I have a very very solid chip here. I am able to do 4.5ghz all core at about 1.325v ( bios and mobo seem to fluctuate a bit over depending on load and vdroop). Here is a screen shot of some CB20 scores I have hit and my current all core config that I have played over 10 hours of Call of Duty and Battle Field with. Everything feels rock solid. 



My current set up -  MSI MEG Ace x570,  G Skill F4-4266C19-8GTZR ( gotta love that Samsung B die) , Gigabyte PCIe 4.0 SSD, MSI Duke RTX 2080ti (only relevant to this because its in my water loop) - Full EK Water loop with a 360mm rad. 



When I timed out my ram I did use the Ryzen timing tool, but I did tweak down some of the timings just a touch, nothing major. Bios seems to be forcing T2 even though T1 is selected, may need a little more voltage on the ram side of things currently sitting at 1.42 which is well below what it could run at. I have noticed that my ram times play a very significant role in this CPU's overall performance. The tighter the timings and the closer to 1900 or higher on the fabric the better.



So based on this I am wondering if anyone else has any info with regard to how much voltage I can push through the chip and get a few years out of it? The gains vrs heat might be more significant if I can hit 4.6 all core but I haven't tired due to fear of damaging the fabric or something with too much juice.  Let me know what your thoughts are!

People will run systems that are delivering less performance for their own reasons.

I'm starting to think of them like vegans or low carb beer drinkers.



There were ample 2700x owners that benchmarked their builds with stock cooling, and aftermarket, noting throttling with the stock cooler.

Doubling cores you'd think would push people to open loops, with an aio as a start point for data.

I guess maybe for multi-gig Ethernet and external drive arrays it may be good but those are a pretty small market for most people that have laptops.



I haven't had a chance to try a TB external GPU enclosure though.



One of the biggest problems I have with the connector is that it looses tightness after a while and stuff plugged in gets very flakey and the slightest movement will make it disconnect.

Apparently nobody did any actual wear testing on the plugs or the sockets before they threw that crap on the market.

I have tb3 on my laptop and not once have i used TB for anything.

It's so niche.



The external gpu enclosures were hyped at one time, but since then, no one seems to be talking about or promoting them anymore. They handicap the full fat gpu with the TB bottleneck, giving external GPUs a terrible cost/performance ratio.

You spend all the money for a rtx2080, only to get like 1660ti performance.



Even worse, faster and faster gpus keep coming out for laptops, so by the time you need to upgrade, there's something relatively affordable that is much faster, without needing to use a clunky external box.



tb3 has been out for ages, and just stagnated, with no tb4 in sight.



TB3 is only relevant for dongle lifers who are forced to use the TB3 ports.

I suspected that my 128 GB's of memory overclock and tighter timings was the culprit, but I'm leaning way over to needing a better cooling solution.  I spent the day running cinebench R20 at different memory clock speeds from 2933 up to the highest stable clock I've managed at 3400 with 14-15-15-15-30 timings.  The memory settings made no difference on my idle temps as they stuck around 53 degrees through all the tests.  What's more, all those settings didn't change my score which stayed just above 13400 the whole time (and that's strange to me as I thought the chip infinity fabric would play a bigger role in that test).  So I have to rule my memory timings out as a cause... and that needle is pointing more to my cooling solution, a castle 360ex AIO.  Just to make sure, I fiddled with CPU core and SOC voltages, trimming them down with still no changes to my idle temps.  Then I took a closer look at what ryzen master was showing, and like your situation all the cores were just jumping around staying busy, so started closing background tasks... and after closing Corsair's iCUE, temp drop 5% right there and the CPU was a lot less active at idle.  I run a rainmeter display as well, and when I shut down that and the HWinfo app feeding the data, dropped another 3%.  So, while taking out some background tasks help, I still have a cooling problem if those minor tasks caused an almost 10% jump in temps.  Running those cinebench R20 benchmarks, I was maxing out at 83 degrees which is still too high for me.  I'm going to reapply the thermal paste although I doubt that's the problem.



The website does indicate a max temp of 68 degrees C, but I have to wonder if that's the same temp measure/sensor used by Ryzen Master, as the temp meter in there doesn't turn yellow until 80 degrees and not red until like 90 degrees, and it also indicates a maximum of 95 degrees... at which time I think the chip throttles."

GPGPU compute is already a niche use case, at least those that need a really heavy duty GPU - so needing a partially portable setup (where the GPU doesn't come with you for it) is even more niche.  Those that are going to spend $1-3k on a GPU will have no issue putting it in an actual desktop or server for when they're home vs. plugging into a laptop."

For most tasks, you won't see much of a difference. The Ryzen systems are mostly SLIGHTLY snappier, but only slightly.



For older games, you won't see much difference between systems either. One outlier is Starcraft 2, where 4v4 games would play nicely on the 3700X while the framerate would start going down on the 4770K. If I won the silicon lottery and the chip would clock to 4.8, that may be a different story.



For newer AAA games, the 4770K had some frame drops that the 2700X and the 3700X don't. (Wasn't able to test the 2600X much since that machine doesn't see much gaming.)



I game at 1080p and even at 60hz, this is noticeable in games like The Division 2. The 4770K will hitch and drop a frame here and there, but for the MOST part, the game is still mostly smooth.



Is it worth the upgrade? This is a 'value' question, but for me -- not so much if you are on a budget. I just happened to need more cores for VM work, and some more PCs.



Can you 'feel' the difference? Yes.

I agree with this assessment. I went from a 4790K to a 3700X.  You will feel a difference, how much of a difference depends on the task. I saw a huge difference in BFV and FFXIV, particularly in large player hubs.  Older games that don't leverage the available cores/threads? You will see / feel a difference but it won't be as pronounced. To me it was worth the upgrade."

The other major use for Thunderbolt is a DAS.  But it really seems like there aren't that many folks here on the [H] who do work with high data needs.  However if you're involved in video editing as an example a DAS is going to be the preferred form of storage for low-medium cost ($500-$3000) setups as it will give the most speed and largest platters at a reasonable cost.  10Gbps Nas obviously not being as fast as 40Gbps and if you're working with raw 4k/6k/8k video you'll need those increased data rates.

			This isn't due to motherboard monitoring software. The temperature spikes occur regardless of whether I have HWInfo64 running or not.



How do I know this? I'm lucky enough that my MSI X570 ACE motherboard has a built-in temperature LED display on the motherboard that I can use to monitor my temperature. The LED display is driven through the BIOS, and not by Windows software. When in the BIOS alone, I never see any temperature spikes occurring.



Also, HWInfo64 appears to be benign, and doesn't trigger the Ryzen temperature spikes (not all board monitors can claim this). Whether or not HWInfo64 is running or not, the frequency of the Win10 temp spikes occur at the same rate. Additionally, HWInfo64 and the MSU motherboard LED displays track each other flawlessly. I can't say the same for Ryzen Master, which appears to be significantly filtering out these temperature spikes.



Most folks say that these spikes are normal. It's true that almost everybody sees them now, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't be fixed.

If you are to watch the CPU frequencies bounce in HWInfo64 you will see they pretty much line up with the temp spikes, as they should.  I just assume it is something in the Windows Core Scheduler causing the CPU to bounce up and down in a cyclic fashion.  Gone are the days when a CPU sat at a single frequency and did not change for optimum performance.  So I guess this is what we get."

Agreed.



It was a stupid frivolous lawsuit.    A CPU core is defined as the integer core, and AMD's FX line had up to 8 of them, and this is a damned fact.



They were absolutely terrible cores, but they were real cores.



All that said, failing to file a claim if you are eligible will not give AMD their money back, so file away."

But in order to follow rules and keep it on topic I personally, having once owned the beloved 3900x monster CPU, would have to say that the included cooler is sufficient only for the CPU with out turning on PBO/PB2 functionality. It just puts out too much heat when auto-oc'd. I would recommend your other cooler for sure if you can find the AM4 mount kit for it. Or get something more aggressive over the stock box cooler."

No need to control the chip to give you a speed of 4.4 Ghz when at that speed the life of the chip degrades.

So, at default, it is sending 1.4v to the chip, especially when idling. That's why I'm looking into this mess. If I tune it and go down to 1.275, I can get all cores up to 4.2 Ghz, which reduces all temps as well.



thesmokingman Would you say that Ryzen Master voltage readings suffer from the same problem as HWinfo? The reason why I ask is because I see current/average at 1.4v, even when idle.



Realistically, I'm not hitting 4.6 Ghz at all, so I could say that my max is 4.5 Ghz when boosting and this is only on two cores and for moments at a time. I cannot get the cores to sustain these speeds with anything: Cinebench, Prime95, Red Dead Redemption 2, Premiere, you name it."

			I wasn't implying it was running 1.5v, I was pointing out that the voltage selection baked into UEFI for multi-threaded workloads will never be as efficient as something you dial in yourself.  It’s going to throw more voltage in to ensure stability across a broad range of chips.
		
		Click to expand...
	
You're completely wrong. Allcore boost will only run the voltage it needs, and that situation is a high current load which is around 1.325v maximum. My 3900x for example runs up to 1.25v for a 3900mhz allcore boost on stock. How is that too much voltage??? Whenever you see 1.4v+ under vcore, using hwinfo, you can then see which CCD is heated up. That will tell you whether its single core or not. As BOTH CCD will never be heated up when vcore is showing more than 1.4v. Whenever the chip shows 1.4v+ it is in a low current load, ie. single thread/core.



Also this suggestion that it's one setting for all is bogus as heck. The algorithms that AMD has developed are not one size fits all. Every chip will have it's own unique behavior driven by the chips thousand sensors."

			Doesn't matter if they claimed it was first or last... if they say it wasn't 8 cores... then it wasn't 6 cores either, whether it was first or not.  The thing is, 'core' is not a standard term, but can mean slightly different things.  HT (hyper threading) shares an ALU, so this isn't just an HT vs. core... it does a good amount more than just hold a thread as it can process operations simultaneously with the other cores.  It's shown that each core (this is in synthetics) past 4 adds about 80% (average some apps better/worse) performance (so not 100% extra core performance, but much more than a HT).  They are just upset that the CPU sucks.  They didn't do their due diligence when they purchased as non of this information was kept a secret.  Like I said, just because something has more cores, doesn't automatically make it better.  There are plenty of systems with high core counts that aren't fast.  If I bought a 24-core ARM chip (https://www.microcontrollertips.com...egrates-24-arm-cortextm-a53-cores-single-die/) and expected it to outrun a 16 core Ryzen, I'd be sorely disapointed.  That doesn't mean it doesn't have cores, it just means I suck at understanding what I'm buying and should probably have asked someone who had a clue.  Can you imagine someone suing GM because their engine cuts from 8 - 4 cylinder mode during cruise because it's not ALWAYS an 8 cylinder?  Or sue ford because all cylinders used to share a carburetor therefore they weren't independent and where fed from a common source?  See has silly this sounds.  I'm sure AMD didn't want this to drag out and try to explain this stuff to a Jury of who knows how much tech they would understand.  Cheaper to just pay and be done.

If it's not a core, and it's not HT... then should they have made up another name for it instead of saying it was a core?  I don't know if that would have led to less confusion or more.

			I was also doing some testing because I was wondering why cpu when in low use doesn't underclock. My temps after long use are around 50 when idle and hits 82 when heavy rendering (Kraken 72x AIO).

Figure out when setting in windows power settings to saving power than finally CPU is undercloking to 2.18GHZ and temps are 40 max when idle and aren't as jumpy. But then CPU barely hits 4GHZ when doing heavy tasks so also not too good.

BTW I have Lian Li o11dynamic xl rog case with 9 (3 on aio) noctua nf-a12x25 fans so no problem with moving air inside.

In reality you will notice a pretty decent increase in speed for video's and gaming (depending on GPU of course).  As you can see single thread is about 58% faster, and multi threading is about 100% faster.  Obviously this is going to be dependent on the actual applications you're running so if you have more info it may help decide.  Also, not sure if you're memory of 64GB vs the 128GB you have now will make a difference (have you had issues of running out of ram or using > 64GB?)."

No way. Custom loop maybe but no AIO will cool better than the setup I have...Thermalright Silver Arrow TR4 with dual 140mm Noctua Chromax fans running full speed.

I have experimented with the volts for a long time and cannot push more than 1.24 (1.23750) volts without temps passing 68C.  Pushing the 1950X past 3.7Ghz at this voltage results in an unstable overclock, not even 3.8Ghz.  I originally started with the Enermax Liqtech TR4 360.  Total garbage...Went through two and both leaked and didn't cool better than my setup now even before they weren't leaking.  I've seen people boast 3.9-4.1Ghz overclocks online.  I don't know what applications they are using but the way Vidcoder pushes every core of the 1950X, averaging 230 watts can't keep the temps lower than 68C.

Specifically any time the board loses power (pull the plug, flip the master switch on the psu, etc) the bios will reset, so the next boot takes longer while it does a self-check. You would only notice if you were booting into the bios to get the message about it resetting to defaults. Some boards were so sensitive it happened just after a regular shutdown, although in that case enabling ERP in the bios would prevent that specific problem (but not the rest).



Some have fixed it by reseating or replacing the cmos battery. Gigabyte said they’re working on a bios update to address some nebulous “cold boot” issues.

It's the Windows 10 telemetry calling back to the mothership. /s



Seriously though, as I understand it some if it has to do with the way that monitoring software and hardware interacts with the system being monitored (in this case, CPU temperatures).   The CPU speeds up so quickly and slows down so quickly during normal operations that, if the monitoring side happens to perform a ""temperature check"" during one of the moments when the CPU is ""awake"", then it will read a higher temperature.  On the other hand, if the monitoring side happens to perform a ""temperature check"" during one of the moments when the CPU is ""asleep"", then it will read a lower temperature.  Also you must consider that even the act of simply performing a simple ""temperature check"" can cause a spike in CPU activity, creating a ""false positive"" in a sense, and the temperature will be read as higher than it would have been if no monitoring were being done.  It's like causing your own problem by checking yourself.  This happens only periodically, so you see these temperature spikes every so often rather than constantly.   Kind of like frequency beating.



This is why most motherboards released recently have fan speed smoothing options.  This allows the motherboard to react to temperature spikes at a more controlled rate so you don't hear the fans ramping up and down constantly.   I have mine set to 15.7 seconds (no idea why Asus has such odd decimal point values as choices - must be some power-of-2 thing in the monitoring hardware timer choices)."

			GPGPU compute is already a niche use case, at least those that need a really heavy duty GPU - so needing a partially portable setup (where the GPU doesn't come with you for it) is even more niche.  Those that are going to spend $1-3k on a GPU will have no issue putting it in an actual desktop or server for when they're home vs. plugging into a laptop.
		
		Click to expand...
	
It's literally the use case that I'm in now.  If you have the money to buy a $1-$3k laptop every 2 years as you've expressed then it's a non issue.  But some of us also don't want to or can't keep buying at that rate.

I'd say it's far more unreasonable for most to keep at that pace versus buying every 3-5 years and only upgrading when necessary.



I can't afford to have a desktop and a laptop.  Let alone a desktop and a laptop that I sink $1000-$3000 x2.  So that might sound niche to you, but it's certainly way more cost effective and cost conscious.



Money solves a lot of problems.  If you have tons of money to throw at every problem then sure an eGPU doesn't make sense.  Just buy a $5000 laptop and a $15000 workstation whenever you want.

I jotted down some numbers from a thread on techpowerup and a video by jayztwocents (YouTube).  When I went into bios I didn't find anything that matched.  Similar, but not a match so I didn't want to dick around with what I wasn't sure of.



All I was able to do was find PBO and turn that off as goldchain suggested, and then enable xmp, because why not... Let's see what happens.  The profile matched what my box said, so I figured it was ok.  The dram voltage lower down the list also seemed to be in line with what id read earlier.... 1.21v I think.   So I think that's ok?



I had another look at the cpu section, and was still unsure the best way to achieve a good adaptive voltage.  My old Asus used to have something called ""additional turbo voltage"" or something where you could assign how much extra power it could use.  This let it idle low, and then ramp up with extra volts when needed. I would imagine ""override + offset"" mode on the MEG works like that, but since I think id be taking the ""auto"" out of the equation, would it sit at the voltage I input all the time?  That's what happened when I used JUST override mode on its own.  If I could override to 1.25v and give it an offset of +0.1, then it would get to that nice 1.35 range that seems to work well for others.... But I'm not sure if that's how it works, or if it's be stuck with 1.25 that never idles down.



Really I just need someone to explain this or put down a breakdown of what needs to be changed where.  Even if just to get things into an acceptable range.  Like I said, I'm not trying to break records here, but I also don't want the stock settings unnecessarily high."

			I was also doing some testing because I was wondering why cpu when in low use doesn't underclock. My temps after long use are around 50 when idle and hits 82 when heavy rendering (Kraken 72x AIO).

Figure out when setting in windows power settings to saving power than finally CPU is undercloking to 2.18GHZ and temps are 40 max when idle and aren't as jumpy. But then CPU barely hits 4GHZ when doing heavy tasks so also not too good.

BTW I have Lian Li o11dynamic xl rog case with 9 (3 on aio) noctua nf-a12x25 fans so no problem with moving air inside.

Yep, sounds like my chip as well... my motherboard has a lot of power control settings like AI control (has the DOCP/XMP setting), performance, TPU, and that precision boost overclock and heck I don't know what half those things do so I leave them at defaults which is usually auto.  As I closed down background tasks, some of the cores actual went to sleep in Ryzen Master and my temps went down accordingly into the 40's.  So it would seem that core voltages play a role but I just don't like gimping the CPU to reach lower temps.  Maybe Asus will improve their AI over time to lower clocks in light loads."

Reading between the lines you couldnt have possibly been recommending that he go out and spend $700 in parts on a custom loop when he said he not interested in water cooling.

was one of the downsides to the spin off of their fabs and continuing to use glofo.. they were always behind or pushing timelines back for processes.. 45nm was late, 40nm was late, 32nm was late and 28nm was scrapped until 2014/2015. llano was the first chips/apu's on 32nm and was suppose to come out in 2009, that didn't happen until 2011 which bulldozer launched at around the same time. also remember that the 14nm process that zen was developed on wasn't even a glofo process, it was basically licensed from samsung with the process development order slightly changed for cost savings. otherwise AMD would still be stuck on 28nm right now.



so ultimately i'd call it more luck then advantage, they bought their way into the process node lead where as intel has been and still is developing everything in house so that's a pretty big key difference. at any point intel could of just thrown in the towel and gone with TSMC's process but they didn't."

I am dying to try air cooling but am afraid to buy one and it won't  cool as well as my h110i.

The case I am using is the Phanteks P400s so you know not the best air flow.

The cooler I like for it's compact look is the NH-U12A .

I may take a chance and buy one, I am sure it wont do as well as liquid but if I can keep it under 85 under heavy load I would be quite happy.

			so when amd says it squeezed out 2x performance per watt by going to 7nm, it's the architecture?
		
		Click to expand...
	
They are making a ratio of performance : power



If performance could be measured as say ...



100 points

Then AMD is stating that at 100 points performance it consumes 100 watts



then AMD changes the process from 14 to 7nm and states that 100 points performance still remains but now consumes 50 watts



They were not claiming that 100 points performance at 100 watts at 14nm is now 200 points performance at 7nm at 50 watts.



The actual performance increases came from architectural changes and the drop in process size allowed them to push higher counts of transistors and higher clocks because the thermals are lower.



So I get what your tryring to say but simply dropping a transistor size in half doesn't automatically assume double the performance.



If size was the metric of performance then the 7nm Radeon VII should have obliterated the 2080ti with its 12nm gargantuan size in comparison. But nvidia architecture was superior even at a higher node size.

There's just no fucking point to testing higher resolutions when you're trying to find out thew maximum speeds a processor is capable of.  The IPC test telly you in percentage how much faster a processor is.  It does noit care what resolution your video card runs at.



This is the same reason why they use a 9900k when testing video cards.  Not everyone owns a fucking 9900k, but it will ,tell you a lot more accurate performance comparisons than if you ran the test on a lowly core i3 9100.

I've been involved in IT and Systems Engineering for 30 years. Core counts have always been based on the integer core. The majority of the instructions your computer does are integer calculations.



This is why they used to sell systems with an optional discrete FPU.

I he thing is, even the ""shared"" CPU could do two instructions at the same time... It was a double wide FPU, so as long as the app was using single precision (most apps), the cores could both perform FPU ops simultaneously as well..  IF but the cores where using double precision at the same time, then it would have to share.  Im not sure the scheduler would be smart enough to keep threads that used double precision separated."

I would just buy an entry-level x570 motherboard.  You'll have all the upgrade options you''ll want to use available, so you'll get a nice life out of it!



This has some good recommendations:



https://www.techspot.com/bestof/amd-x570-motherboards/



Also, if you live near a Microcenter, they have an the best deal on that 3600:



https://www.microcenter.com/product...m4-boxed-processor-with-wraith-stealth-cooler



And you can bundle a motherboard to get $20 off the combo.



Just so we're clear here: Zen 3 is as ar as Socket AM4 goes.  But the consoles that are going to be released later this year will all have Zen version 2.  They will use an undercloked 3700x (8 cores)

I'm considering an upgrade to something like a 2700/3600 but what's keeping me from pulling the trigger is DDR5, coming out this or next year potentially and it's significantly faster than DDR4. I kinda wonder if the i7 to Ryzen upgrade feels significant because DDR3 wasn't super amazing so I should hold off.

I just replaced my 4770 with a 3600.



For me, the difference is remarkable.



I probably am not a typical user. My PC for one is used as an IP cam server in the background (https://blueirissoftware.com/). Also, I tend to have many (20-40) browser tabs open as well as multiple applications including Powerpoint, Word, Excel, Acrobat, voice recognition, remote login to Citrix server for work. Then, the occasional VM and then on top of that, open a game like Rome 2 or something.



This was too much for my 4770, with all this going on my CPU load was in the high 90s to 100 percent and things were noticeably slow.



Enter the 3600. The 3600 can run all of this and not bat an eye. I have not gone above 50% processor utilization yet and performance is quite good, subjectively. Temps are not excessive on stock cooler.



I had thought I would need something with more cores, like the 3900 to deal with all of this workload but I am stunned to find that the 3600, which I got for exactly $160 (!) can handle it all."

			Capacity?   Performance?   Flexibility to set things up the way you want it?



I tend to always try to do things with a real server abd avoid appliances as much as possible, including even more Enterprise oriented brands like QNAP.



Whenever I can use server hardware, I do.  Even my router is running on PC hardware with using pfSense.



Also, IMHO, it sounds like a really bad idea to out your storage on the same device that is your WAN bridge and firewall.



My storage server has 2x 8c/16t xeons 256GB of RAM, 12x 10TB hard drives, 8x SSD's in various caching etc. purposes, and dual 10gig Ethernet adapters.  



I can probably get about 2GB/s reads off of the hard drive storage array, and it supports a lot of stuff I do in my home.



Can't do that with a raspberry pi.  
		
		Click to expand...
	
Basically this. X86 offers plenty of options for different usecases, in efficient sff designs all the way up to full server hardware (which is still efficient if you configure it properly and fully utilize it). 



Nothing wrong with rpi or other arm solutions, they're fine too. But you probably wouldn't want tarabytes of raid storage on a rpi nas with just 1gbps serving multiple (3+) clients concurrently, for example. NAS boxes are expensive, so if you have a spare system with lots of sata ports and decent network hardware (a couple gbit ports, 10gbit, or room to add a 10gbit or dual 1gbit nic), why not use it?"

I could also go mobo first though that would be much more work. 



I ran across the Ryzen 9 Pro when I was looking at CPU's supported by my Asus ROG Crosshair VI Hero. My powers of google cant seem to tell me what is different between the Pro and a 3900 other then clock speed/tdp. If they are the same can I use a mechanical pencil to upgrade? 



Picking between the 3900x and the 3950x is being a difficult choice for me. Upgrading over time, say a big part (cpu/mobo/ram/pcie 4 nvme) ever 2-3 months means the price difference isnt a super big deal. For gaming / browsing though it doesnt seem to be much of a difference.

		Click to expand...
	
Doesn't matter if they claimed it was first or last... if they say it wasn't 8 cores... then it wasn't 6 cores either, whether it was first or not.  The thing is, 'core' is not a standard term, but can mean slightly different things.  HT (hyper threading) shares an ALU, so this isn't just an HT vs. core... it does a good amount more than just hold a thread as it can process operations simultaneously with the other cores.  It's shown that each core (this is in synthetics) past 4 adds about 80% (average some apps better/worse) performance (so not 100% extra core performance, but much more than a HT).  They are just upset that the CPU sucks.  They didn't do their due diligence when they purchased as non of this information was kept a secret.  Like I said, just because something has more cores, doesn't automatically make it better.  There are plenty of systems with high core counts that aren't fast.  If I bought a 24-core ARM chip (https://www.microcontrollertips.com...egrates-24-arm-cortextm-a53-cores-single-die/) and expected it to outrun a 16 core Ryzen, I'd be sorely disapointed.  That doesn't mean it doesn't have cores, it just means I suck at understanding what I'm buying and should probably have asked someone who had a clue.  Can you imagine someone suing GM because their engine cuts from 8 - 4 cylinder mode during cruise because it's not ALWAYS an 8 cylinder?  Or sue ford because all cylinders used to share a carburetor therefore they weren't independent and where fed from a common source?  See has silly this sounds.  I'm sure AMD didn't want this to drag out and try to explain this stuff to a Jury of who knows how much tech they would understand.  Cheaper to just pay and be done.

If it's not a core, and it's not HT... then should they have made up another name for it instead of saying it was a core?  I don't know if that would have led to less confusion or more."

This temperature spiking may be considered ""normal"" or ""within tolerance"" by AMD, but constant temperature cycling / demand peaks will reduce the lifetime of the motherboard power section components (primarily, the capacitors) and the CPU.



A lot of folks upgrade their systems every few years. I don't.



I don't experiment with overclocking for the same reason. The last water-cooled system I overclocked was dead in under two years due to a motherboard component failure.

Unfortunately, you won't notice much if any improvement on the gaming front. AMD has caught up to and slightly surpassed Intel's IPC, but the design of Zen2 falters slightly on the gaming front compared to Intel. The exact reasons for this are complicated, but its due to several factors. To combat this, AMD threw a crap ton of cache memory at their CPU's, which really did close the gap significantly, but it's still there in some games. 



I ran a 5960X @ 4.5GHz for almost five years and the upgrade bug bit me pretty hard. I ended up running an AMD Threadripper 2920X which was a step backwards in gaming performance. I switched to a Core i9 9900K, which was a step backwards from the Threadripper everywhere but gaming. I did run a 10980XE briefly, but I shipped that CPU off to David for our AIO testing setup. I'm now running a 3950X, which seems to be the best balance of price and performance. It isn't much of an upgrade from my 5960X on the gaming front, but I haven't really noticed much of an impact from switching from the Core i9 9900K to the 3950X. My games are smooth as ever and multitasking and everything else I do are better than ever.



Even though the Core i9 10980XE was faster most of the time, the difference isn't huge. Not only that, but the 10980XE made my office much warmer than the Core i9 3950X does. While benchmarking, I've seen the 10980XE hold temps just under 110c which is its throttle point. That was with no-AVX offset @ 4.7GHz, but you get the idea. It didn't run that hot normally, but it still seemed to have warmed my office more than this 3950X does."

			That's not a bad idea, I was looking at old PowerEdge servers initially, but then thought of the noise and amount of power used and thought otherwise. However, I could see this working out well if I just bought the board with RAM and cpu and threw it in a new non-rack mount case... I'll consider that as well... but I may as well go for a setup with dual xeons... you can get those for super cheap now-a-days as well
		
		Click to expand...
	
I have an old power edge, it is loud and sucks down power.  I'm thinking about building out a 3600 to replace it at some point to save power and have more single core speed.  It's great in threading (dual 6/12 xeons, so 12/24 total with 96gb ram) but a bit slower for single threaded things and power hungry.  I am probably going to hold off for the 4000 series desktop parts since I'm $ constrained and what I have works.  My point was, while the poweredge is fun with all the advanced server features (you can remote setup the BIOS and remote mount an ISO image for an OS install, etc), it's showing its age (mine is an R710).

			This is my first time overclocking anything. For good reason. Up until now, I don't think I've had a processor that has numbers that act so weird. I've never really had to overclock as I was happy with the stock speeds and general working of the chip.



However, while Zen 2 are incredible processors, they seem to act kind of weird.



After I read your post, I put everything back to stock and ran Cine R20. During the test, these were the values:



Temp: 71C

Speed: 4.1 Ghz

Power Draw: 110 W

Volts: 1.38

Bench Score: 7021



Going back to the profile I created, I had this during the test:



Temp: 65C

Speed: 4.2 Ghz

Power Draw: 96W

Volts: 1.27

Bench Score: 7340



Everything about these settings seem better than stock, although admittedly I'm not an expert.



Do these numbers not tell a better story in your opinion?
		
		Click to expand...
	
Your settings are better than stock for heavily multi-threaded apps.  Where they will fall down is with gaming.  Your single core performance will be locked at 4.2 GHz.



Unfortunately, Ryzen throws more voltage than necessary at all core performance for the sake of being able to reach max clock speeds on individual cores.  This creates more heat.



If someone could create a UEFI that adapted in real time to changing workloads between heavily threaded and lightly threaded in a better way, that would be nice, but I have a feeling the juice isn't worth the squeeze.  The current implementation is the best compromise from AMD and it's pretty good.



You should look into overclocking by CCX or CCD to try and get the best of both worlds.  Have one part of your chip locked to an all core overclock and let AMD do what they want with the rest."

ryzen master gives more accurate readings at idle, under load the 3rd party apps are accurate other than when cores drop below i think it's 2500mhz then they start freaking out and reporting incorrect clock speeds since the bios stops reporting clock speeds below 25x multiplier which is the lowest you can set it to in bios.

There were rumors about Zen 2 having at least one part with 16 cores and hitting clock speeds of 5.0GHz or better. These were absolutely unfounded. I can't believe anyone fell for that in the first place. 



The thing is, AMD is doing allot with Zen 2. They are increasing core counts and IPC substantially. The fact that they managed to increase clock speeds at all is actually something of a miracle while doing everything else. 12 cores and 4.6GHz boost clocks speeds with a 105 watt TDP is quite impressive. The thing is, its extremely difficult to increase clock speeds, keep the old TDP and improve IPC. Generally IPC improvements and clock speed increases don't happen together at all, much less to the massive degree the rumor suggested. That's why I never believed it. 



That said, we do not know what, if any overclocking headroom these CPU's have. My guess is that they'll have next to no headroom and the best we can hope for is to level the boost clock across all the cores at once much like we do with Threadripper and Ryzen 2000 series CPU's now. We might even have to drop slightly below the boost clock to do that, but we'll see. I'm still trying to get sampled on these things.

The faster cpus don't have the apu. Cpu wise the best low end cpu atm is the 1600AF at 85 bucks, or the 2600x at 99 if you have a MC nearby. Btw I think that 2600x is gonna go on sale for 79 this weekend at MC.



The other option is to wait for the Zen2 apu to come out. Those will be in line with Ryzen 3 cpus and they are damn fast. Right now they will be released in the form of mobile chips but eventually we will see them in apu form.

You sort of did when you mentioned "" I dont recommend air cooling for the 3950x. AMD doesnt either."" So I mentioned that AIO is also an air cooler in comparison to a true loop. 



Reading between the lines you couldnt have possibly been recommending that he go out and spend $700 in parts on a custom loop when he said he not interested in water cooling. So that means by logic you were possibly thinking AIO. But I cant put words in your mouth. It was just an assumption based on a logical interpretation. Sometimes that's all we have to go on in somewhat ambiguous replies. For all I know maybe you were suggesting a full custom loop.

I definitely would only recommend getting a Zen 2 CPU at this point (Ryzen 3xxx) for the big IPC gains.  12 Zen2 threads with higher frequency and IPC > 16 Zen+ threads with lower clockspeed in most usage. 3600 or 3700X are probably the sweet spot for price/performance and depending on your workload the 12 or 16 threads should last you a while.  If you want to spend more obviously there is the 3900X and 3950X, 3900X at around $400 - $420 with 24 threads is great and puts the 9900K to shame in multi-threaded workloads and close enough gaming performance. 



Another big reason to upgrade is support for the much faster NVME SSDs in the m.2 form factor which Z97 didn't really have.  Have that for your boot drive paired with any Zen 2 chip and man, you'll really be flying."

I just did some reading on amazon reviews, someone there compared the H75 performance with the Coolermaster Hyper 212 and the H75 was better.  So yes, the H75 would be a good improvement over the Wraith Prism.  I find the AIO liquid coolers to be overpriced for the performance, but their one advantage is fitting into tight spaces.



Corsair H75 > Coolermaster Hyper 212 > Wraith Prism > Wraith Stealth in cooling performance.  But again, with tweaked fan profiles, even the Stealth does a good enough job.  So unless you are picky about noise and temps suggest just sticking with the Wraith Prism.



I have a personal preference for cheap tower coolers due to their good bang for the buck.  Obviously one needs adequate space inside the case to go that route."

Yeah, a 3600 is a good value chip for now!  Buy the Zen 3-based 4000-series on discount in another year or two.



Zen 3 is expected around August, so it's going to be awhile.  I would just purchase the 3600 now then upgrade to as 4700x (8 core) or 4900x (12 core) when youi need it.



You should get about 15% higher perfirmance per-core with Zen 3, and games wll eventually jump up to 8 cores.  So eventualy, you'll get a total gaming performace increase of 50% over your 3600!



Zen 4 will require a a new socket, and new DDR5 ram.  You won't need to upgrade to that anytime soon.

			""Some things just make too much sense I suppose. ""



Yes, when you assume your conclusions.  I don't play, own or have loaded any games currently because I am playing an MMO I have been playing for a decade + off and on. It does not ramp up the Rad fans at all the way I have it set: 50% speed all the way to 73-75C. Your problem understanding what I am doing is based on your  assuming I have the games I want to play and am just sitting on them wanting to test my system with a synthetic. Uh, yeah,  that would be asinine, right?



My plan all along was to keep the fans as silent as possible, I mean, duh?



I'm just tweaking my system now, so down the line, when I do load a game that challenges cooling, I don't have to deal with it then--for many reasons, like maybe I won't have the time to fuck with it? I like to be proactive.



""Why not simply set a custom fan curve that tops out at 50% . . . ."" Yeah, you probably would do something like that.



You don't need to set a profile at 50% top speed  to see if the temps will get out of hand. That's fucking idiotic. All you need to do is set it like I have it: 50% fan speed up all the way to 75C, then start ramping up in a short delta curve to 100% at 80C. If the fans start spinning, then you know the heat is at or past 75C.



Sorry for that nasty last comment, but your snippy shit remark pissed me off. You get what you give.



However, setting your CPU fan to top out t 50% in order to test heat . Really? <face palm>
		
		Click to expand...
	
If my comment pissed you off, you're too sensitive for the internet. Don't expect me to walk on eggshells because you're hyper-sensitive. It's not gonna happen.



Now as to your previous comments, i'll dumb it down so you understand. I personally would not limit my fan speeds to 50%. I actually know what i'm doing and would not have made a dumb thread to begin with... BUT... Since you're too dense to figure out what I was saying, here it is again in more elementary terms.



YOU don't like the noise levels above 50%

THEREFOR, I suggested limiting it to 50% WHILE monitoring to ENSURE you aren't overheating/throttling.



Please let me know if this was too complicated for you to make heads and tails out of. And if this post pissed you off well... lol"

			there's probably some language somewhere on some marketing material that led to this ....not the argument of whether or not 8 core was 8 core because it did or did not share a component of what makes up a processor's execution pipeline.



Considering that FPU's were considered completely separate processors up until the 486, I'm totally on board with the argument that fpu's can be removed from the definition of a processor core.  



Now can we finally get a class action lawsuit against disk storage manufacturers for redefining words to make their capacities inflated?   A terabyte is not one thousand gigabytes and a gigabyte is not one thousand megabytes.  A megabyte is not one thousand kilobytes, and a kilobyte is not 1000 bytes.  Bytes are measured in base 2 because they measure bits which are binary.  It's not hard, every new metric is 2^10 of the last (1024).   This is far more intentionally misleading and far more impactful false advertising than what AMD could be considered to have done.
		
		Click to expand...
	
AMDs marketing was pretty clear how the CPU was layed out, and it's not like they didn't have benchmarks to look at before buying.  The claim in the lawsuit was based on AMD calling them cores, since they shared an fpu (which could do 2 simultaneous 128 bit calcs at the same time) and some of the decoding hardware (which IS a more valid argument, but still not really).  I'm not sure, but the fact that it only covers 8 core (not 6 that are the same layout) seems very odd."

There's no throttling at 68C, it just reduces XFR boost. It doesn't drop below base frequency until much hotter (which is throttling).  I don't think there's anybody that OCs a threadripper meaningfully that stays anywhere near 68C under load, and there are plenty here that oc them quite a bit."

			I had a H100 and tried even an H60 and could not keep it below 95 sometimes on all core testing.  These things get hot.  And they throttle back after 80, from what I have read, to like 4.3 or something.  With the Noctua I rarely see over 80 when pushing it with tests.  Sure it will stay down any other time but what can I say.  If my case had more room above the motherboard I would have tried bigger coolers myself but the heatsinks on the MSI up top get in the way in my case.  Maybe the H110 is that much better though.

This does not appear to be the case with the OP. He will be happy if it's under 85C and he's also sure it won't cool as well as his H115i which means his current cooler is already capable of keeping it under 85C which is all he's expecting from the air cooler. Which brings me to my question, what am I missing?

it's not icue, i've seen that same suggestion and tested it myself. it's some kind of check that happens, either in windows or something internally in the CPU since it repeats the same pattern about every 5 seconds.

			Hi - I have a Win10x64 (v1909) running on my MSI X570 ACE + Ryzen 3900X system.



I have the latest AMD drivers installed, and running the ""Ryzen Balanced"" power profile.



Even with absolutely nothing installed on a fresh Win10 installation, I see periodic 8 to 10 DegC (around 36 DegC => 46 DegC) spontaneous temperature spikes once every 10 seconds or so.



Does anybody know what in Win10 is causing these temperature spikes? I know that the new Ryzen CPUs are more sensitive to core boosting, but I would really like to get my system running cooler with less of these temperature spikes.



Thanks,

just set your first audible fan ramp up step slightly above where the spike peaks and set a cycle delay on how quickly the fan speed reacts to the spike. other than that i really wouldn't worry about it.

			That seems off to me, on my board I literally can't manually overclock any better for all-core unless I go way out of my way to do CCX/CCD specific stuff. Typically without even touching anything you should be seeing 4.2ghz all core, but I guess that really depends on the motherboard/cooling.



Make sure you don't have PBO enabled or any other weird motherboard vendor 'OC Mode' type of things enabled.



For reference with my 3900x I see 4.2~ghz all core, 4.5+~ghz single core with all default settings relating to the CPU. I have a similar style cooler and see around 70c heatsoaked full load all core.

			Ryzen 2 is so inexpensive now and you probably are NOT going to see anything worth while in paying for a premo x670?? if that thing even comes out.



Why not just get a 3600x or something right now. Sell it when Zen 3 comes out, consider your loss in value a ""rental fee"". Get an X570 now because Pcie 4.0 is not going to be any better or faster on x670.



All B550 brings is pcie4 and really not a single thing else. I dont know maybe some bluetooth revision or some nonsense.



Zen 3 is going to be DDR4. AMD emphatically stated DDR5 will not be until 2021 minumum probably 2022 tbh. So get some 3600mhz CL 18 and clock it down to 17 or 16 cas.

Those are heavily cherry picked dies and it takes making months and months and months of slabs of silicon before they get enough to go to market with. Probably going to be 2021 before you see 50x chip drop. But I could be wrong. Dont hold your breath though.

Its hard to say - with each revision of Ryzen, AMD has been pushing the upper end number of cores on release day.  Ryzen 2 had 8 cores / 16 threads on release, Ryzen 3 had 12 cores / 24 threads on release, and it may not out of the question that release day there will be a Ryzen 4 16 / 32 thread, with a 20 / 40 part (or whatever) released a few months later.  We'll find out in a few months.

When I last moved, I pulled apart the WC on my Ivy Bridge in my sig (read, dropped the case and broke the rez and didn't feel like replacing it) so I currently have 2 unused Thermochill 120.3 rads with the original, wider fan spacing that may not be terribly useful mounted inside of a case unless I get an adapter of some form.  My intention is to use 1 or both of those old Thermochills and a 120x4 rad, as I want to run my loop with CPU and full coverage block for a Geforce 3080ti (or whatever it will be called).

I don't fit the title perfectly but wanted to provide my experience as I feel it's still pretty applicable. Upgraded from a 3970X @ 4.4Ghz to a 3800X which I use at 4.4Ghz all core. Regular Windows usage with basic Internet and Office applications is a little noticeable. Boot time is definitely faster but that's due to faster POST and NVME drive. I mostly game at 4K and 1440P so gaming performance is nearly identical with a few games having better .1% lows.  BF1 benefited most of course thanks to the Frostbite Engine.  



While the gains in some areas of usage are modest for those of us making the switch, I think the Ryzen CPUs will show even greater improvements over time as newer applications and games become more aware of additional threads."

I think the OP is mostly looking for FP performance data for historical purposes - for practical purposes vector FLOPS are somewhat tenuous since a lot of applications have computation patterns that aren't readily vectorized, or are completely bandwidth bound.



To answer the OP's questions:



Sandy Bridge/Ivy Bridge: 8 DP FLOPS/cycle

Haswell/Zen2/Skylake client: 16 DP FLOPS/cycle via single cycle MAC

			When I get home from work ill try and post some tips and just some general rules I followed when trying to push my chip. I am not sure that I am doing it right... but its working ok so far. I have trying really hard to get stable at 4.6ghz even on just on set of cores and its not happening even at crazy voltages. It appears my chip hits some kind of power usage threshold and shits the bed. Raising my voltage just brings it to that envelope quicker, doesn't really seem to help with the OC much. One thing I like about my board is it has an AMD overclocking voltage setting that lets me dial it up and down by .1mv so I can do 1.34 or 1.35 and it kind helps me keep it on the lower end of what I think is acceptable for voltage.



I recently installed the newest Beta Bios for my MEG ACE x570 and really didnt see any difference in PBO or any of that junk.



I think there is something to be explored with the way that the BIOS is telling the OS what the fastest core is, and the preferred power preferences which the setting name escapes me right now. But I have tried to use Ryzen master, and its idea of stable is a joke. It wont finish Cinabench R20 with Ryzen master stable. So I have no idea what its doing to determine that.



Just from what I have seen you should be able to get a R20 run out of 1.325v at a 43x multi, I think 1.35v all core is too high for anything under 4.35ghz , again this is relating back to that total power window I am seeing with my chip. So once the chip fully loads up, there is some voltage magic happening behind the scenes that I just cannot figure out. Everything gives a slightly different read and the pins on the board do not explain how the chip is using the voltage its being given. One of the biggest things that was causing my OC to fail for the CPU wasnt the CPU at all, it turned out I was having some issues with Memory and timings. I have some G-Skill Trident 4233 19 19 19 36 the RBG kind. Which is B Die. I dial it back to 3800 and set my Fabric to 1900, ANYTHING over 1900 on my fabric causes weird crashes, and anything under 1700 with higher ram speeds will also cause my system to crash. So I am not sure if its a total golden silicon situation or if its all about finding the perfect balance of timings/stability. XMP isnt worth using unless your kit is a 3200 or 3600 kit. The sub timings be set to auto are just garbage most times. I used the Ryzen D-Ram Calculator to get a good baseline and then sort of tweaked to stability.



I guess kind of for testing, I would set your fabric to something reasonable like 1800 and ram to 3600, it looks like your Fabric was around 1866 or something in that higher range. Also try 16 , 16, 16 across the board on those times you listed above. I notice your running cl16 with 15tras and 15 row timings. I have never had luck with my CL timing being higher than my refresh timings, I dont know how Ryzen would judge that latency wise or how the controller reacts. Row cycle time should be good around 42 to 46 i would think at those speeds. Or get the Ryzen D-Ram calc and try that out and see where fast puts you.





Also just make sure PBO is off, mine was on auto and it was actually lowering my CB scores with whatever my bois was doing with it. I also disable Cool and Quite.





This is GoldChain btw... Just for whatever reason I have two accounts... and didnt realize it lol

Thanks for the info and your time.  Hopefully, I'll be able to mess around with it tonight.  I think the memory controller on mine is weak.  I shouldn't need the voltage I'm using for the RAM.  It's B Die spec'd at 4000 19-19-19-39 at 1.35v.  Someone else mentioned that 16-15-15-32 is an odd timing.  Maybe I'll make it 16-16-16-32."

5ghz seems to be the silicon stone wall.  I bet zen2 will oc up there with proper cooling.

That's not true. It's an upgrade if the IPC improvement claims are true. A 15% upgrade and boost clocks up to 4.6GHz would put Zen 2 in a pretty good spot. Especially with 8c/16t and 12c/12t parts on the high end. Node shrinks aren't magic. As I said, when your improving processors, you can generally go for higher clocks, or higher IPC, but generally not both. AMD did manage both from what we've seen thus far. AMD managed to not only improve IPC by 15% (which is huge) but increase boost clocks fairly significantly. They did this while keeping a 105w TDP and increasing core counts. All that's damn near too good to be true as it is. Wanting 5.0GHz and all that just isn't realistic. 



I wouldn't hold out hopes of achieving 5.0GHz through overclocking either. Like I said, you'll probably see 100-200MHz and load all cores if your lucky. Your TDP will go through the roof, but that's probably the best you can hope for.

			if thats the case then all I have to do is decide 3800 or 3900. For everyday task and gaming would the 3800 be the better choice?



well can't wait for reviews, anyone got any idea when we can expect some?

The embargo date is 7/7/19. Its unlikely you will see anything before then. AMD tends to sample chips only a week or two out from the embargo date. Reviewers don't have their hands on them yet. I'm working with motherboard vendors to get X570 samples which aren't available yet and won't be for at least a couple weeks or more. Reviewers aren't often left with much time ahead of launches to work with the hardware."

			I've pulled my fair share of AMD CPUs out with the HSF lol, never damaged a pin when this happened...

Also you can say the ""same"" for intel boards.... ""hope you never ever drop the CPU or screwdriver/screw or ANYTHING on the mobo pins accidentally...""

Pins on CPU are easier to fix BTW.

Oh and if you twist before pulling the HSF that fixes the pulling out of the socket thing, works every time.

True, i've dropped my HSF on to an intel socket and destroyed it, those pins are virtually impossible to straighten. That was my bad and I've since learned never to remove the protective cap until I'm ready to put the CPU in there.



While damaging Intel socket pins is harder to fix then damaging AMD CPU pins, I find it easier to avoid. I've had mixed results with the twist method. Sometimes it breaks loose, other times it merely rotates while still being glued to the CPU."

They look ok but the power draw vs perf seems off. You're looking at discrete clocks, not the real clocks or more accurately effective clocks. There is a small learning curve with Matisse chips and later releases. Thus I suggest you read up on the way Matisse, Zen 2 works. It is different from 99.9% of chips before it. I wrote a quick post on setting up monitoring these chips. The linked info will help you understand how the chips work. If you are on stock voltage, you can ignore voltage readings. As for overclocking, I don't really bother with it 24/7 that is. When I do overclock I use a ratio overclock, and skip allcores no point to that.

			A scheduler wouldn't middle man opcodes being run by a process.  That would be incredibly slow.  There would need to be some kind of 'exclusive core' flag the process would need to set that the scheduler would have to be aware of.  I don't think such a thing exists on Windows or Linux.

I mean just like modern computers have a flag to say if it uses the FPU so it knows whether it needs to store/load the fpu registers on task switch, if it had one for double precision tasks it could keep them from running on the same shared FPU (keep them separate) so you could have up to 4 double precision tasks running that aren't sharing or waiting.  If they are on the same shared group, they would have to wait for one another.  It can run 8 things (including single precision floating point) at the same time... This I would consider 8 cores with some shared resources.  I didn't mean for th scheduler to middle man anything, just be aware it's using it so it can intelligently run threads/tasks... Kind of like the latest updates (I think in 1903) they Microsoft finally made it smart enough to not switch ccx on AMD cpus. (Linux had this solved during gen 1 zen).

That seems off to me, on my board I literally can't manually overclock any better for all-core unless I go way out of my way to do CCX/CCD specific stuff. Typically without even touching anything you should be seeing 4.2ghz all core, but I guess that really depends on the motherboard/cooling.



Make sure you don't have PBO enabled or any other weird motherboard vendor 'OC Mode' type of things enabled.



For reference with my 3900x I see 4.2~ghz all core, 4.5+~ghz single core with all default settings relating to the CPU. I have a similar style cooler and see around 70c heatsoaked full load all core."

The 3960X is almost twice the price as the 3950X.  I'm going wo wait a few months and see what the Zen 3 chips offer.  I like to push the overclock of the processor only as far as it is SAFE without going nuts and with air cooling.  Not interested in the headaches of custom water loop and AIOs can't cool better than the Thermalright.  AMD says the max. safe temp for the 1950X is 68C.  Do you know what it is for the 3950X and 3960X?"

TB3.. for what purpose? TB docks absolutely suck. USB-C docks aren't much better if at all.



I guess maybe for multi-gig Ethernet and external drive arrays it may be good but those are a pretty small market for most people that have laptops.



I haven't had a chance to try a TB external GPU enclosure though.



One of the biggest problems I have with the connector is that it looses tightness after a while and stuff plugged in gets very flakey and the slightest movement will make it disconnect.

I have a Ryzen 3900X with an AMD X570-based motherboard for future-proofing.



My new system is really fast, and a very nice upgrade from my 7+ year-old machine. There are a lot of bottlenecks that have been removed from the older tech - such as: speedier DDR4 RAM, USB 3.1 / 3.2, NVMe SSD, PCIe 4.0. Plus, the increase from 4 cores / 8 hyperthreads to 12 cores / 24 hyperthreads has made a huge difference.



Waiting for other minor tech improvements, such as DDR4 to DDR5 shouldn't hold you back at this point. It's not like your system will run twice as fast with a DDR4 to DDR5 change. There are always new tech / slightly upgraded CPUs on the horizon, and if you are always holding off due to the promise of new tech you'll be living with your slower old tech forever.

			I've been out of the pc hardware game for a long time now... last build I did was a sandy-bridge. When you say APU, do you just mean that the chip has integrated graphics which doesn't require a dedicated gpu? If so I think that's what I'll go for, since the server won't be doing anything graphics intensive. Thanks for the info.

Yes on AMD its called an APU, accelerated processing unit. 







However it's not just an igpu like Intel, since AMD is a huge proponent of the HSA thing, their apus are HSA. A side not, HSA was a primary driver in AMD winning the DOE contract.

Because I use emulators a lot, I'm waiting for Zen 3 to upgrade my older systems.  My 4790k really needs a 30% performance increased to make this worthwhile (and I'll also double core count!)



Or if Zen 3 disappoints I can always wait for DDR5.  I have no pressing need to encode vast quantities of video anymore, so the Handbrake speedup would only matter around Christmas.



I'm also waiting for AMD to release desktop Zen 2 APUs, as AV1 has hit Youtube with a vengeance.

No it is not  life will go on as usual. It won't change things that much it is just that you are feeling anticipation towards something you might want to purchase or skip, what helps is to ignore it all together even after reviews and see how well it goes for others.

I am certainly going to wait and see what is happening on the overclocking front and maybe just skip Zen 2 all together for the simple reason that it might not work that well for me on my X370 and X570 should be expensive and a total waste of money if next year we get DDR5 which makes the decision a lot easier."

Just pasting this for you becasue it is the best I can do to explain what  want to do:

I'm strictly trying to find an optimal noise level for cooling when playing games. I'm playing an old MMO right now that uses the Unreal engine, but its DX9, so it doesn't even push my 2012 PowerColor 7950. I get no noise from CPU cooler as the CPU never gets above 65C or so. 



After the fans on the AIO get past 50%, they start getting noisy. If I can keep them below 60% when playing a higher end game, then I won't really need to worry about noise anymore."

Now as to your previous comments, i'll dumb it down so you understand. I personally would not limit my fan speeds to 50%. I actually know what i'm doing and would not have made a dumb thread to begin with... BUT... Since you're too dense to figure out what I was saying, here it is again in more elementary terms.



YOU don't like the noise levels above 50%

THEREFOR, I suggested limiting it to 50% WHILE monitoring to ENSURE you aren't overheating/throttling.



Please let me know if this was too complicated for you to make heads and tails out of. And if this post pissed you off well... lol

Buildzoid Safe Static Voltage on Ryzen 3000 Series



thesmokingman Thanks for the links about monitoring with HWINFO and RTSS.  I'm going to set that up tonight.
		
		Click to expand...
	


That guy rambles on too long and I'm not sure he got it either. If you want the safe voltage for your particular cpu, it was explained how to get there by the Stilt a ways back. Here's a reddit post that encapsulates the important parts.








	
	
		
		
			So basically this means the maximum FIT voltage is around 1.325V (not 1.325V, around 1.325V) under high current scenarios but this maximum FIT voltage, depends on the silicon characteristics. Meaning chips with different silicon characteristics will have different voltage tolerance meaning one voltage can not be the maximum safe voltage for all chips.
		
		Click to expand...

			So yeah, 1.325V is not safe. The maximum safe voltage for your personal zen 2 cpu is... I have no clue. If you want to be able to find this voltage turn on PBO and max PPT, TDC and EDC and run a worse-case workload as of The Stilts recommendation.

The above test will give your specific chips maximum safe FIT voltage. Also, be aware that Stilt's degraded his chip at 1.33v in a month with high temps.

That's not a bad idea, I was looking at old PowerEdge servers initially, but then thought of the noise and amount of power used and thought otherwise. However, I could see this working out well if I just bought the board with RAM and cpu and threw it in a new non-rack mount case... I'll consider that as well... but I may as well go for a setup with dual xeons... you can get those for super cheap now-a-days as well"

And, by the way, your comment is definitively wrong.



After doing a little more research myself, I've found several game demo tests, like the old Far Cry, that run your machine like it will in the game. So, yeah, their are, and they do exist. You should focus your efforts on computer content, rather than personal attacks.

			Just pasting this for you becasue it is the best I can do to explain what  want to do:

I'm strictly trying to find an optimal noise level for cooling when playing games. I'm playing an old MMO right now that uses the Unreal engine, but its DX9, so it doesn't even push my 2012 PowerColor 7950. I get no noise from CPU cooler as the CPU never gets above 65C or so.



After the fans on the AIO get past 50%, they start getting noisy. If I can keep them below 60% when playing a higher end game, then I won't really need to worry about noise anymore.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Why not simply set a custom fan curve that tops out at 50% play all the games you want to play while monitoring your temperature. If it doesn't get at or near throttle temps, call it good.



EDIT: I see this suggestion was already brought up. And IMO, is the correct one even if OP didn't like it. Not sure why you'd want to download an extra piece of software to ""simulate"" when you can actually test using actual games you're actually going to play. Some things just make too much sense I suppose."

Posting this because I was looking for some help. Hopefully put this in the right sub-forum



I recently built a new computer (specs in signature) but one thing I have noticed is much higher GPU usage in Chrome coming from the old computer to the new computer. As in, while playing video I'm seeing GPU usage between 45-55% (in task manager).... which is really weird on just video playback on Youtube. (attached a picture for reference)



Normally I wouldn't be a problem, but as I run dual monitors... I often have say, a video going on one monitor while I play games on the other. And in this configuration, I have noticed not insignificant framerate drops in some games.



My old computer was was a i7 4770K & GTX 1080... replacing the 1080 really wasn't a choice (it stopped working about a month ago) so I replaced it with a 5700XT which was shortly after I built my new computer around a 3700X.



Regardless, I do not remember it having this problem until recently when it started to run out of cores, hence the CPU upgrade, but now I'm in some sort of weird GPU usage / bottleneck situation as its got plenty of cores and memory to work with.



And now I'm not really sure what to do to fix the problem?



I was also wondering if the iGPU on the Intel processor was helping the GTX 1080 do stuff like play video on Chrome while I was playing games... and if so would it make sense potentially to switch to a 4700G APU when those come out?



Or is this purely a GPU bottleneck so the recommendation would be to purchase whatever new GPU comes out later this year that's more powerful?



Just looking for some thoughts around what would be the best options?

You've got B550 coming out, then presumably we will see X670 launch when Zen 3 actually drops.  At that time re-evaluate all the options.  You also don't have to deal with potential BIOS issues.



The other stuff you mentioned wouldn't hurt to pick up now.  I personally hate sitting on new components for months.  You might not be able to test if something is DOA, and you'll have to RMA to manufacturer rather than exchange with Amazon/Newegg/etc... There might be better deals down the line, especially once we get closer to being out of this pandemic.  I would only pick up things if it's a really good deal.  Keep an eye on here in the deals section and use slickdeals.



This will also give you time to research the ""best"" PCIe 4.0 NVME SSD (I personally would just get a Sabrent Rocket on PCIe 3.0 and call it a day... lol 3500Mbps read is fast enough for me and I'd even go back to using a SATA SSD and it wouldn't kill me). Zen 2 can usually handle 3733MHz RAM give or take, so I hope Zen 3 has improved IMC so might pay to hold off to see what kit works best.  Hoping for 4000MHz achievable but that's probably more wishful thinking than anything.  You don't want to be stuck with 3200MHz RAM that can't clock high if Zen 3 can push RAM."

Just a quick reminder make sure you flash the BIOS to a supporting version first.  Lots of people had issues with Zen2 or Zen+ booting on B350/X370 boards without updated BIOS and that's why AMD was doing the bootkit thing where they send a CPU.  Some boards can flash BIOS without a CPU though.



Obviously it's your money but I would do no higher than a 3700X if planning to immediately upgrade to Zen 3 when it comes out.  3900X or 3950X should probably hold up until socket AM5 platform starts coming out."

As to the original question, I went from a 1920X to 3950X, it was a very large jump and I got decent money for the tr4 setup on the used market.  I reused the psu, ram and cooler (the corsair aio has mounts for both tr4 and am4) so total cost was only around $400.

You are the first person I heard pushing the 1950X past 68C and much hotter at 85C.  Excessive heat profoundly shortens the life of a processor.  Plus there is throttling past 68C which is counterintuitive."

			It's literally the use case that I'm in now.  If you have the money to buy a $1-$3k laptop every 2 years as you've expressed then it's a non issue.  But some of us also don't want to or can't keep buying at that rate.

I'd say it's far more unreasonable for most to keep at that pace versus buying every 3-5 years and only upgrading when necessary.



I can't afford to have a desktop and a laptop.  Let alone a desktop and a laptop that I sink $1000-$3000 x2.  So that might sound niche to you, but it's certainly way more cost effective and cost conscious.

I just don't know of many uses cases that are going to saddle a high end GPU with a mobile 8 core cpu (at best).  If you're doing that type of compute, you're likely going to want to feed it with a high end, high power cpu.  I'm not sure what your use case is, but a $2000 desktop you can upgrade in stages and $500 laptop you carry around for 3-5 years might be a much more effective setup than a $1500 laptop and $1000 egpu enclosure setup...And the storage can be directly attached to the desktop motherboard, no need to saddle yourself with TB3."

The extra memory bandwidth means some games yield up to 10% higher performance.



For anything 32-core or less, the stock turbo boost is identical top  the 3950x (and you can just clock the 48 and 64-core versions higher, at the cost of power)



Since they've fixed the memory controller setup, the per-core scaling is a lot smoother in everything."

The lower clocks on CCD0 are (AFAIK) cores that have been partially idle / sleeping during the sample period, that gives an average clock for the period.

Dont get me wrong, HWinfo is a very good program, and I use it a lot myself.



You just cant trust it completely as a tool for this kind of analysis.



Otherwise I have no comment to your endeavour about manually clocking the 3900x, I'm certain you can strike a good balance.

I leave my 3900x on auto,  and trust AMD to know what they are doing with the clocks and voltages.

			Agreed.



It was a stupid frivolous lawsuit.    A CPU core is defined as the integer core, and AMD's FX line had up to 8 of them, and this is a damned fact.



They were absolutely terrible cores, but they were real cores.



All that said, failing to file a claim if you are eligible will not give AMD their money back, so file away.

			The faster cpus don't have the apu. Cpu wise the best low end cpu atm is the 1600AF at 85 bucks, or the 2600x at 99 if you have a MC nearby. Btw I think that 2600x is gonna go on sale for 79 this weekend at MC.



The other option is to wait for the Zen2 apu to come out. Those will be in line with Ryzen 3 cpus and they are damn fast. Right now they will be released in the form of mobile chips but eventually we will see them in apu form.

The workstation for day to day stuff isn't a lot different, but overall the system feels faster and multitasks way better.  I do photography, and it seems like certain edits go a lot faster on the Ryzen.  I used to start having a lot of trouble doing certain stuff with the 4790k and watching Netflix at the same time.  Netflix would just stop until the edit was done and then resume.  I don't have that any more, but a good part of that went away switching to Linux.  My desktop runs OpenSuSE, but I migrated before I upgraded hardware.



I don't play the same games I used to on my HTPC, but I do think it is faster.



If it were something where the upgrade was a financial concern, I would have been perfectly fine to stick with the 4790k, maybe just built a HTPC.  I had a huge upgrade itch, and I am quite happy for the upgrade.  If you do video editing or 3D rendering you'll probably see a bigger jump (Quick Sync notwithstanding)."

			Well I feel silly now.  Have to report that the Arctic Freezer 34 came with 3 sets of standoffs.  Once I determined which standoffs to use, the heatsink installed properly without any free play even though the backplate was loose before screwing the heatsink in place.  It was an Amazon warehouse purchase without manual or docs, and the video above was unclear.  All installed now and works fine.



Question, 1 of my 4 case fans plugs into the AIO header on the motherboard currently.  The wire for the Arctic Freezer 34 has an extra connector.  I think it would be better to plug this case fan into this extra connector.  Reason is that I think the AIO header does not allow fan speed changes in bios but the extra connector will allow fan speed changes.  Is this correct?

it does, you just need to change the header setting in the fan control in bios from pump to PWM or fan most likely."

			My Thermaltake Floe Riing 360 Premium Edition AIO is a beast. It's not as good as a custom loop, but it does work very well. It can pretty easily handle a 9900K @ 5.0GHz, a Threadripper 2950X @ 4.2GHz all core and so on. It couldn't really handle a Threadripper 2990WX though. Temps are better on my custom loop, which obviously has greater heat dissipation capacity but it gets the job done for a variety of high end CPU's.

			I just don't know of many uses cases that are going to saddle a high end GPU with a mobile 8 core cpu (at best).  If you're doing that type of compute, you're likely going to want to feed it with a high end, high power cpu.  I'm not sure what your use case is, but a $2000 desktop you can upgrade in stages and $500 laptop you carry around for 3-5 years might be a much more effective setup than a $1500 laptop and $1000 egpu enclosure setup...And the storage can be directly attached to the desktop motherboard, no need to saddle yourself with TB3.

			I'm running a 3970x on an ASUS Prime TRx40-PRO MB... Air cooled with a Noctua single fan in a Thermaltake case.. CPU is NOT over clocked but I did select the recommended overclock on the RAM.

CPU idles between 39C and 44C.  During a ""hard"" Prime95 test it got to 81C and stabilized there.   I'm quite impressed with the ""cheap-o"" air cooler..  My Intel based computers are water cooled (with simple AIOs) and they all run hotter than this.



I have ordered a second 140mm fan for the cooler and see if I can have load temps in the 70s
		
		Click to expand...
	
I have to think that's pretty good for a 3970X on air--are your room ambient temps pretty low too?  Just to be clear, when you say stock, you mean at straight 3.8 MHz?  I've been chasing this low temp ghost on my 3960X and so many variables seem to play into the equation, like the default motherboard bios setups which on mine (zenith II extreme) include a lot of ""performance"" and precision boosting settings on auto.  I always considered ""stock"" not touching any settings, but that's just not the case anymore I think.  Turning those off to a straight 3.8 MHz (the base clock stock), I'm idling at 35 C with the TR edition of the Thermaltake Floe Riing 360.  When I run the Prime95 small FFTs for the maximum power, I'm getting to 81 C as well and on the smallest FFTs getting to 75 C.  I see Asus is looking at releasing a 420mm TR aio, so there may be a new crop of coolers more suited to the new TR coming out over the next year."

			I have tb3 on my laptop and not once have i used TB for anything.

It's so niche.



The external gpu enclosures were hyped at one time, but since then, no one seems to be talking about or promoting them anymore. They handicap the full fat gpu with the TB bottleneck, giving external GPUs a terrible cost/performance ratio.

You spend all the money for a rtx2080, only to get like 1660ti performance.



Even worse, faster and faster gpus keep coming out for laptops, so by the time you need to upgrade, there's something relatively affordable that is much faster, without needing to use a clunky external box.



tb3 has been out for ages, and just stagnated, with no tb4 in sight.



TB3 is only relevant for dongle lifers who are forced to use the TB3 ports.



For my pc laptop, with its abundance of ports.... dual displayport, hdmi 2.0, usb3/c, I have no need for my TB3 port

Decide if you need more cooling from there and adjust accordingly.

Accounting.  I have pretty free reign to buy things when the family is under budget.  I can work in a 200 purchase here, a 300 purchase there no problem.

Considering that FPU's were considered completely separate processors up until the 486, I'm totally on board with the argument that fpu's can be removed from the definition of a processor core.   



Now can we finally get a class action lawsuit against disk storage manufacturers for redefining words to make their capacities inflated?   A terabyte is not one thousand gigabytes and a gigabyte is not one thousand megabytes.  A megabyte is not one thousand kilobytes, and a kilobyte is not 1000 bytes.  Bytes are measured in base 2 because they measure bits which are binary.  It's not hard, every new metric is 2^10 of the last (1024).

Going to Steam from the publisher FREE on steam link results in a Steam pay only link. I'm DL it now from Tom's Guide as I don;t have time to jump through Steam's hoops to try and find the free version that the link on the publisher page is suppose to link to.

I'm strictly trying to find an optimal noise level for cooling when playing games. I'm playing an old MMO right now that uses the Unreal engine, but its DX9, so it doesn't even push my 2012 PowerColor 7950. I get no noise from CPU cooler as the CPU never gets above 65C or so. 



After the fans on the AIO get past 50%, they start getting noisy. If I can keep them below 60% when playing a higher end game, then I won't really need to worry about noise anymore.

You need to trust in AMD's implementation and let the chip do what it needs to do. This has been covered to death, but manually overclocking this generation is basically a waste of time outside of certain edge-cases.



Basically, you're overthinking it. Just focus on the RAM settings and leave the CPU default."

For most tasks, you won't see much of a difference. The Ryzen systems are mostly SLIGHTLY snappier, but only slightly.



For older games, you won't see much difference between systems either. One outlier is Starcraft 2, where 4v4 games would play nicely on the 3700X while the framerate would start going down on the 4770K. If I won the silicon lottery and the chip would clock to 4.8, that may be a different story.

			Games, pretty variable. Older games that were already pushing well over 100 fps or games heavily GPU bound, little to no difference. Games that need a decent CPU along with GPU like BF:V or COD:MW there's a noticeable difference. Significant improvement in BF:V, particularly the minimum FPS bit less drastic of a difference in COD:MW

I'd also add, in those games that hit both the CPU and GPU, the combination of the 3900x using substantially more power and it being able to push my 1080Ti to 100% utilization the entire time equates to a lot more heat being dumped into the room. On a brisk night, gaming on the 3770k would make the room go from cool to a quite comfortable warm. The 3900x ups the ante and makes it uncomfortably warm without cracking the window wide open. On a warmer but not hot day, I pretty much have to run the AC to maintain comfort while gaming."

Hi, SnowBeast - I already tried nec_v20's profiles a few weeks ago. nec_v20 did great work on that!



However, it doesn't do anything about the Ryzen temperature spikes - the temperature spikes still occur using his configurations.



I have an update regarding HWInfo64: When HWInfo64 is running in the background in my extremely minimal Windows To Go setup, it does not cause the CPU temperature to cyclically spike. You can run the HWInfo CPU Temperature tray icon without affecting the CPU temperature.

My intel says went tits up last week.  I had to scramble to build a new system as its a workstation, and i didnt want to be down to long, potentially turning away work.  After all the good things i heard about the new Ryzen stuff, i decided to go AMD this time.  I ended up with a similar setup to GoldChain...



3950x

MSI MEG ACE

G.Skill Ripjaws V Series F4-3200C16Q-64GVK



Iv only had the system running for 2 days.  I had a bunch of issues getting my 3 gpus to show up in windows, and realized the m2 drive in slot 1 was the problem.  I can get 3 gpus with an m2 in slot 2, but not an m2 in slot 2 and 3... i guess im at the lanes limit there as the 3rd GPU disappears from windows.  For now, since this board only offers a measly 4 sata ports, i opted to remove 1 GPU so i could run the 2 m2 drives instead.   Once i finally got things working, and started setting up windows, i noticed the idle temp was rather high, averaging in the high 40s.  I googled and that lead me here to this thread.



My previous system was an i7 5960x.  It OC'd realy well, but ill admit im pretty dumb when it comes to OCing.  I was handheld by a more season Asus user for the most part, and he helped me dial it in, showed me what to change, etc.  So here I am now, being forced into AMD land, and i have no idea what alot of this stuff is.



Goldchain says hes doing his adjustments in BIOS, and thats how i prefer to work as well.  I did poke around in there briefly after looking thru this thread, and i did do 1 adjustment by using the Offset Voltage mode to reduce the voltage by 0.2.  That definitely helped with the temps, and right now, HWInfo is telling me im in the mid 30s.  Iv only barely started to install apps and what not, so i havent put the system under any kind of stress testing yet, but before i start doing that, i was hoping you guys could help me get things set up to where they should be, as reading not only here, but elsewhere, that MOST of the bios settings are way off from where they should be.



I see a couple screenshots of RM above, and looking at them, i see alot of values that look like some of the terms i remember seeing in the bios.  Is it possible to take one of those screenshots and just transpose those values into my own bios?  Is everything labelled the same?  Im sure i wouldnt shoot for the moon right off the bat though.  Actually my intent for this system wasnt to overclock it since iv read there isnt much headroom in these CPUS as it is.  I think if i was able to hit 4.3 id be very happy, but if i was using anything above as a guide, i would work my way up to that.



Either way,  since this is Goldchains thread, and he had realy good results, im hoping he can help me out and give me some pointers here, but im open to suggestions from everyone!  But remember, this is all new to me, so im sure ill need a bit of hand holding to work my way thru it.



Thanks in advance!  Looking forward to taming this board a bit!"

clock speeds king in flight sims even with the added multi-threaded performance in xp11 1.50(vulkan) and fs20.. so yeah you'll see gains with the higher boost clocks of the 3800x or even 9900k(though lga1151 is now dead with the upcoming release of the 10 series). 3900 and 3950 are pointless and you'll see no real performance improvement with the added cores so i'd only go for them if you needed the extra cores/threads for something outside of flight sims."

In laptops its perf/watt.



There is no doubt that with 7nm process, AMD has passed Intel Perf/watt.
		
		Click to expand...
	
AMD already surpassed Intel with perf/watt, in laptops, during the zen+ APUs. With the Zen APUs (nominally called 2000 series), they were at least matching it.



However, AMD had some seriously high static power (idle power was much higher than Intel), which sapped away any of the power efficiency of the Zen cores themselves. In mixed use and max power loads, even the horribly designed and constructed first/second gen APU laptops showed a lot of promise.



Another factor that made buying their APUs a poorer choice in high end laptops (where idle power isn't a big problem) was AMD's decision to limit their APU platform to 12 PCIe lanes. That simply isn't enough. GPU takes at least 4 (2 is doable, but the low end GPUs that work well with that + optimus, aren't worth pairing with an APU), NVMe takes 4 (again, 2 lanes is doable; consider that many higher performance laptops have 2 or even 3 M.2 NVMe slots...), leaving just 4 for everything else. GbE LAN? WWAN? WiFi? Any super high speed USB-C or SD card reader? The mythical TB3 AMD laptop (the Thinkpad was just confirmed to NOT have TB3 at all)? So AMD wasn't set out well for high end laptops, either.



With Zen2 APUs, they seem to have fixed the idle power draw. Mixed use and max load power draws are still better than Intel. There have been hints, that AMD has upped the PCIe lane count (maybe to at least 16?), but I haven't been able to find solid numbers.



Either way, I'm excited!"

			You may find that letting the CPU boost on it's own and adding autoOC into the mix may provide faster performance in gaming. I've seen some back and fourth on that depending on the game. It also depends on the model. The lower end parts like the 3600X and 3700X seem to benefit more from manual overclocking due to their lower boost clocks. The 3900X and 3950X benefit less from doing that outside of a few rare applications and games.

			I just did some reading on amazon reviews, someone there compared the H75 performance with the Coolermaster Hyper 212 and the H75 was better.  So yes, the H75 would be a good improvement over the Wraith Prism.  I find the AIO liquid coolers to be overpriced for the performance, but their one advantage is fitting into tight spaces.



Corsair H75 > Coolermaster Hyper 212 > Wraith Prism > Wraith Stealth in cooling performance.  But again, with tweaked fan profiles, even the Stealth does a good enough job.  So unless you are picky about noise and temps suggest just sticking with the Wraith Prism.



I have a personal preference for cheap tower coolers due to their good bang for the buck.  Obviously one needs adequate space inside the case to go that route.

cheers.



i have used H75's on both my existing builds - my htpc with an i5 4440 and my main pc with an i7 5820k - and both have done 5-6 years now.

but since then the wraith's have come along with a good rep, so don't want to spend £75 for a marginal performance improvement.



as i'm replacing both systems shortly i'm tempted to give the prism to the 3600 (to use in the InWin901), and get an AIO cooler for use with a 3700x/3800x (in my FT05 case).

which is why i'm interested in which AIO 120mm will perform signifiantly better than a prism (to make the ~£80 worthwhile)..."

			This isn't due to motherboard monitoring software. The temperature spikes occur regardless of whether I have HWInfo64 running or not.



How do I know this? I'm lucky enough that my MSI X570 ACE motherboard has a built-in temperature LED display on the motherboard that I can use to monitor my temperature. The LED display is driven through the BIOS, and not by Windows software. When in the BIOS alone, I never see any temperature spikes occurring.



Also, HWInfo64 appears to be benign, and doesn't trigger the Ryzen temperature spikes (not all board monitors can claim this). Whether or not HWInfo64 is running or not, the frequency of the Win10 temp spikes occur at the same rate. Additionally, HWInfo64 and the MSU motherboard LED displays track each other flawlessly. I can't say the same for Ryzen Master, which appears to be significantly filtering out these temperature spikes.



Most folks say that these spikes are normal. It's true that almost everybody sees them now, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't be fixed.

You're mistaken regarding the MB temp sensor, ie. the led display. That display is showing die averaged temp, not individual core temp. What you are seeing in windows are the individual core sensors reacting during context switches, ie. what you are calling spikes. In essence you are monitoring temps in a non-ideal way. The spikes are indeed NORMAL. If you don't wanna see it, change the way you monitor temps and cpu cores etc etc.

But in order to follow rules and keep it on topic I personally, having once owned the beloved 3900x monster CPU, would have to say that the included cooler is sufficient only for the CPU with out turning on PBO/PB2 functionality. It just puts out too much heat when auto-oc'd. I would recommend your other cooler for sure if you can find the AM4 mount kit for it. Or get something more aggressive over the stock box cooler.

Oh, I got you, I wasn't taking offense or anything.  I'm trying to keep this as cheap as possible for the server build, but still get a little better than stock performance.

Went from an i7 6900K to Ryzen 9 3900X. Last time I use an AMD in my main rig was probably 2008-ish (K9 Windsor/Brisbane?). I do some gaming at 3440x1440 and while most reviews would tell you CPU matter less at higher resolution, the minimum frame rate definitely have increased in my case. Exporting videos & encoding... definitely smashed the 6900k.



I have a few question for you guys:

1. I guess this is normal behavior but just want to be safe: Even with the Noctua heatsink, the CPU still hit 86°C (same as the stock cooler) when running heavy tasks, is this normal? I see vcore at 1.5v and boost clock at 4.6Ghz comparing to 1.45v and 4.4Ghz on the stock cooler. All settings are at stock in EFI (enabled XMP profile using Asus Ai Tweaker D.O.C.P, everything else is Auto).



2. Regarding AMD's PBO... There are TWO PBO settings in the EFI: one under ""Ai Tweaker"" and one under ""AMD Overclocking"". Are they the same? Right now both are on Auto. I tried enable them one at a time and then both but in all cases that result in lower boost clock.

			How high will the auto boost go if the game is only using 4 cores?
		
		Click to expand...
	
The boost clock rating for a 3900X is 4.6GHz. The CPU is incapable of clocking more than one or two cores to that high of a speed. It isn't a matter of not being able to do that many simultaneously, but rather the CPU only having one or two cores good enough to overclock that high in the first place. I can't give you a concrete answer as it will vary greatly as a lot of variables impact the result. However, it is possible that you could end up seeing numbers higher than 4.2GHz on four cores. This is where I've said that your results from manual overclocking vary. The more heavily threaded a game is, the more it could benefit from a manual overclock. 



In testing, I found games like Hitman 2 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider to benefit from a manual overclock at 4.3GHz. However, other, more lightly threaded games benefit more from being left up to PB2+AutoOC. Because this often leads to questions about PBO vs. PB2, I'll go ahead and throw it in there. PBO results are hit and miss. Generally it seems more effective on the 6 core or 8 core parts. The 12c/24t and 16c/32t parts don't seem to benefit from PBO at all. In some cases, PBO actually performs worse on those chips than PB2 does. Theoretically, you can add a 200MHz auto-OC to PBO for a total of 4.9GHz on a 3950X but in reality, you'll never see clocks beyond 4.7GHz if you see that at all."

The safe voltage you should run is no more than 1.4v with a conservative Load Line.

1.35v with an aggressive load line.



These are observations I have made on my own platform since day 1.



I get the best thermals and performance @ 1.32 volts and I am fully watercooled.



Remember your custom loop doesn't allow one to be retarded with their OC's. It just lets you be more aggressive. Dont go full retard and you will be good!



Lastly keep in mind that a idle chip can safely run 1.5 or more volts as long as you dont load it. Just becuase something appears stable at 1.4+ v doesn't mean it needs that much.

Yes, this is true. However, such a part isn't going to be clocked at 5.1GHz or anything like that. I'd wager that its probably clocked at 4.6GHz (boost) or less. As you said, it steps on Threadripper and right now AMD doesn't even need the part in its mainstream offerings. Intel has nothing to combat a 4.6GHz 12c/24t Ryzen part if the IPC improvement is accurate."

The 3400G is pretty much out in my opinion as a 1600AF with a GT710 is a couple dollars cheaper for much better cpu performance.

			was one of the downsides to the spin off of their fabs and continuing to use glofo.. they were always behind or pushing timelines back for processes.. 45nm was late, 40nm was late, 32nm was late and 28nm was scrapped until 2014/2015. llano was the first chips/apu's on 32nm and was suppose to come out in 2009, that didn't happen until 2011 which bulldozer launched at around the same time. also remember that the 14nm process that zen was developed on wasn't even a glofo process, it was basically licensed from samsung with the process development order slightly changed for cost savings. otherwise AMD would still be stuck on 28nm right now.



so ultimately i'd call it more luck then advantage, they bought their way into the process node lead where as intel has been and still is developing everything in house so that's a pretty big key difference. at any point intel could of just thrown in the towel and gone with TSMC's process but they didn't.

AMD's best decision was to spin off GloFo and then being able to hedge their bets with multiple fabs.  They're not tied to tsmc, either, they can take their business elsewhere.  If Intel uses another fab house, they lose billions if they have to idle their existing plants (or they can try to drum up external customers again, which they failed to last time).  The only 'luck' part is that tsmc is ahead of Intel by a country mile process wise, but I have a hard time conflating engineering prowess and good decision making with luck."

I feel a little stupid now.  I changed RAM timings to 16-16-16-32 and still got horrible performance.  So, I went back in and removed the -.1 offset from core voltage.  I guess I though Ryzen Master was taking care of this, but I guess not, because I got further.  I set voltage to 1.325 in Ryzen Master.  Now, I can get the sh!tlet to 4.3 and the chiplet to 4.425 and pass Cinebench.  However, with the sh!tlet at 4.3, and the chiplet from 4.35 up to 4.425, I get the same score 7655.

you should run the same bench as OP at stock, then neuter your fan curve and rerun the bench at higher temps.

If you're considering a 2700 or 3600 then you have a budget in mind/bang for the buck type of upgrade, otherwise you'd go 3900x/3950x. With that in mind, waiting for DDR5 wouldn't really make sense. The memory itself is going to be quite expensive not only because it's so new but because there will be manufacturing/inventory hurdles with this whole Covid19 stuff going on.The motherboards will also be expensive for the same reasons. The CPU's will be new and not discounted at all. Unless you're prepared to spend quite a bit more than the upgrade you're eyeing currently, its a non-starter unless the plan is to pickup a 2nd hand 2700/3600 for even less from those going the DDR5 route. Then there's the big question of real-world benefits of more bandwidth in the tasks you intend to perform on the machine."

			I have an old power edge, it is loud and sucks down power.  I'm thinking about building out a 3600 to replace it at some point to save power and have more single core speed.  It's great in threading (dual 6/12 xeons, so 12/24 total with 96gb ram) but a bit slower for single threaded things and power hungry.  I am probably going to hold off for the 4000 series desktop parts since I'm $ constrained and what I have works.  My point was, while the poweredge is fun with all the advanced server features (you can remote setup the bike and remote mount an ISO image for an OS install, etc), it's showing its age (mine is an R710).

This is almost exactly what I was considering. Was looking at the R710's on Amazon for about $200.... fond memories took over of when I first became a net admin- these were the servers everyone was using. In some ways it's a great deal, but in other ways it just doesn't make sense for a home server... particularly the power usage and noise!



So yes-  I believe I'm just going to go with the 3400 and spend maybe 4-500$ on a ""cheap"" build which should be completely adequate for what I'm trying to do.

Here is what I have: 


	


As you can see, I have two cores that hit 4.5 Ghz, two that hit 4.4 Ghz, 5 that hit 4.3 Ghz. The rest are lower than that. I was doing a ton of stuff, from gaming to editing, to rendering audio and video, etc. Would it be correct to assume that if I have these numbers for several hours of use, they could be the maximums of these cores?



You'll also see that average voltage applied throughout this time was just under 1.4 volts which my brain still says is a lot.



I did even more testing today, going from stock to the profile that I mentioned here (4.2 all core @ 1.275v). Here are my findings:




TempPeak SpeedPeak CPU Power %Average VoltsTDC%EDC%Cine ScoreStockIdle4415.51.412218Cine724.1115 (not a mistake)1.37961007108RM Profile (4.2 @1.275v)Idle42181.0934Cine664.295.41.27517237307


As you can see, I have small gains both in peak speed as well as Cine Score. However, these small gains are happening with lower temperatures when running Cinebench, likely due to the big difference in volts being sent to the CPU.



So, for everyday computing it seems like this profile would likely be a good balance between speed, power, and temperature, thus fan quietness.



My next step would be to look into overclocking by CCD or CCX, particularly to get better speeds for gaming. A few days ago, I was playing Red Dead Redemption 2 and streaming to Twitch via OBS and my fans were running at either full speed or very close to it, The case was very loud, so loud that I could hear it through my headphones while playing the game although I use open back phones.



I have to add that I have never seen the current speed at 4.5 or 4.4 Ghz. If these cores are hitting those speeds, they are for very brief moments and they do not do it frequently. Taking this into consideration, would it make that much of a real-world difference if I managed to clock some of these cores at 4.5 Ghz or 4.4 Ghz via CCD or CCX manual speed settings?

It also depends on what you are doing.  If you're doing multiply-accumulate, you get twice as many  operations per-clock (it's a trick most GPUs use)



But if you're not doing that, then just assume a single operations per-clock , per-data-slot in the AVX units. The amount each slot is taken up based on the size of that data type.



Single-precision FP is 32-bits.



So for a processor with 2 AVX 256-bit units, you get 256 + 256 = 512-bit total vector width, and the  divide that by 32 to get the number of 32-bit slots, or the peak operations per clock.

This resolved the issue! It's not using my GPU at all even when playing video and just running off CPU and CPU is perfectly happy giving it a single thread for video...



Now fully can use GPU for the games.



It must have been before the hardware acceleration was going through the iGPU on my 4770K which is why I never noticed the effect of hardware acceleration.

""Some things just make too much sense I suppose. ""



Yes, when you assume your conclusions.  I don't play, own or have loaded any games currently because I am playing an MMO I have been playing for a decade + off and on. It does not ramp up the Rad fans at all the way I have it set: 50% speed all the way to 73-75C. Your problem understanding what I am doing is based on your  assuming I have the games I want to play and am just sitting on them wanting to test my system with a synthetic. Uh, yeah,  that would be asinine, right?  



My plan all along was to keep the fans as silent as possible, I mean, duh?



I'm just tweaking my system now, so down the line, when I do load a game that challenges cooling, I don't have to deal with it then--for many reasons, like maybe I won't have the time to fuck with it? I like to be proactive. 



""Why not simply set a custom fan curve that tops out at 50% . . . ."" Yeah, you probably would do something like that.



You don't need to set a profile at 50% top speed  to see if the temps will get out of hand. That's fucking idiotic. All you need to do is set it like I have it: 50% fan speed up all the way to 75C, then start ramping up in a short delta curve to 100% at 80C. If the fans start spinning, then you know the heat is at or past 75C.

			I tested the 2920X against the 3900X when the Ryzen 3000 series launched. The 3900X was faster in almost every single test. Often by quite a large margin. I have no doubt this would translate to the 1950X and the 3950X. In fact, the gap is likely slightly larger as the 2000 series Threadrippers saw some improvements over their 1000 series predecessors.



The biggest place you'll see a difference is in anything requiring single-threaded performance. Gaming is a great example of this. The extra L3 cache and the topology of the processor are all designed to help mitigate the latency penalties earlier processors had regarding crossing CCX boundaries.

This is what I've seen online with some of the benchmarks.  I do not game, but rather use my build almost exclusively for handbrake encoding.  Handbrake likes and uses multi-threaded processors, hence why threadripper exceeds at this.  I use extremely high encoding settings and I am going to be increasing 4K encoding where with the 1950X I average 2.5 - 4 FPS, which is tediously slow.  If I were to consider building a 3950X rig, I would have to see percentage wise how much faster Handbrake performance I could get to justify the expense."

			There were rumors about Zen 2 having at least one part with 16 cores and hitting clock speeds of 5.0GHz or better. These were absolutely unfounded. I can't believe anyone fell for that in the first place.



The thing is, AMD is doing allot with Zen 2. They are increasing core counts and IPC substantially. The fact that they managed to increase clock speeds at all is actually something of a miracle while doing everything else. 12 cores and 4.6GHz boost clocks speeds with a 105 watt TDP is quite impressive. The thing is, its extremely difficult to increase clock speeds, keep the old TDP and improve IPC. Generally IPC improvements and clock speed increases don't happen together at all, much less to the massive degree the rumor suggested. That's why I never believed it.



That said, we do not know what, if any overclocking headroom these CPU's have. My guess is that they'll have next to no headroom and the best we can hope for is to level the boost clock across all the cores at once much like we do with Threadripper and Ryzen 2000 series CPU's now. We might even have to drop slightly below the boost clock to do that, but we'll see. I'm still trying to get sampled on these things.

There were rumours about  Zen 2 turbo hitting 5 ghz not base clock speeds. It is not that far fetched since you can lookup where the turbo are on other models (4.6 or 4.7) (XFR or PB might boost this).



If you know that the best silicon ends up in servers  you can draw your own conclusions on possibility  of a single 5ghz turbo core.



sparks There is a youtube channel called AdoredTV he started speculation on information he got from sources, the stuff he posted on his youtube channel was used by several other media outlets and used as facts that is how you came to believe it was going to happen.

Air will never catch up to water, it's physics.  Air coolers need a lot of surface area to dissipate heat.

			Yes, this is true. However, such a part isn't going to be clocked at 5.1GHz or anything like that. I'd wager that its probably clocked at 4.6GHz (boost) or less. As you said, it steps on Threadripper and right now AMD doesn't even need the part in its mainstream offerings. Intel has nothing to combat a 4.6GHz 12c/24t Ryzen part if the IPC improvement is accurate.

Supposedly, we are going to see some six and eight-core parts with higher clock speeds on the existing Zen 2 architecture later this summer, even though Zen 3 products are going to launch later this year.  (October, per the aforementioned video)



What do you guys think of this?  Personally, I think this is a pretty plausible rumor. It would cost AMD very little in terms of capitol investment to make this happen, and ever-improving 7nm yields at TSMC would make it easy to bin chips up to a higher frequency without having to change the chiplets themselves from an architectural standpoint.



I will also say that if we do see this come to fruition, this bodes extremely well for the performance of Zen 3.  If AMD is willing to release faster clocked versions of their existing Zen 2 SKUs, then they must be very confident in the performance gains presented by the Zen 3 architecture and 5nm TSMC node shrink.  Otherwise, they would be ""competing against themselves"".



Still no word right now on the specifics.  I would expect something like a ""Ryzen 5 3650X or ""Ryzen 7 3820X"" or something like that."

You need to trust in AMD's implementation and let the chip do what it needs to do. This has been covered to death, but manually overclocking this generation is basically a waste of time outside of certain edge-cases.



Basically, you're overthinking it. Just focus on the RAM settings and leave the CPU default.

This is my first time overclocking anything. For good reason. Up until now, I don't think I've had a processor that has numbers that act so weird. I've never really had to overclock as I was happy with the stock speeds and general working of the chip.



However, while Zen 2 are incredible processors, they seem to act kind of weird.



After I read your post, I put everything back to stock and ran Cine R20. During the test, these were the values:



Temp: 71C

Speed: 4.1 Ghz

Power Draw: 110 W

Volts: 1.38

Bench Score: 7021



Going back to the profile I created, I had this during the test:



Temp: 65C

Speed: 4.2 Ghz

Power Draw: 96W

Volts: 1.27

Bench Score: 7340



Everything about these settings seem better than stock, although admittedly I'm not an expert.

			So, at default, it is sending 1.4v to the chip, especially when idling. That's why I'm looking into this mess. If I tune it and go down to 1.275, I can get all cores up to 4.2 Ghz, which reduces all temps as well.



thesmokingman Would you say that Ryzen Master voltage readings suffer from the same problem as HWinfo? The reason why I ask is because I see current/average at 1.4v, even when idle.



Realistically, I'm not hitting 4.6 Ghz at all, so I could say that my max is 4.5 Ghz when boosting and this is only on two cores and for moments at a time. I cannot get the cores to sustain these speeds with anything: Cinebench, Prime95, Red Dead Redemption 2, Premiere, you name it.
		
		Click to expand...
	


First, read the link from post 9 so you understand how Matisse works. Just by saying you see 1.4v average means you are misunderstanding the average voltage. Average voltage is USELESS to us EXCEPT when we are measuring within a specific timeframe, like for ex. the average voltage thru a benchmark run. And to make that happen you hit the reset button on hwinfo, run bench, check voltage, etc. Otherwise, average voltage in HWINFO is again useless. To understand this ya have to watch the actual core voltage or die average, package, core vid effective etc etc. The voltage readings of ALL monitors are inherently limited when it comes to Matisse because they cannot differentiate between 1.4v+ going to a single core vs the whole die. When a single core is boosting, it will call for 1.4v+ however that voltage is actually only going to the specific core that called for that voltage. The problem as I wrote is that monitoring apps see that voltage as going to the whole chip instead of which half of the chip it is really going to. Hence the voltage yall are seeing is not exactly accurate and why average voltage is USELESS.



If you are going to watch the voltage with a keen eye, you have to put it in context with the CCDs in the case of a 3900x or 3950x. When you see die average voltage at 1.4v+, you then have to take a look at the CCD temperature. CCD idle temperatures will never be mistake for loaded temperatures right? This is the important part, you will never see 1.4v+ being shown at the same time that both CCDs are heated up. This is because the chip only allows a single core to use the maximum voltage. To put it plainly you have two CCD. when one is heated up and it shows 1.4v+ that means it is only running a single core. That's how you verify what the real voltage is. Owners of single CCD chips don't have this luxury so I suspect they will always be freaking out if they don't understand how the voltage works.



As for your overclock, you are overclocking and limiting volts to 1.275v. Yea its going to run cooler because you are not allowing the chip to boost up and if you are running 4.2ghz you are running 300mhz above base clock. Thus ofc it is faster, BUT you are losing 400mhz on single core boost. Again read the links I posted, use hwinfo and monitor the right temp/voltage sensors. Read the link by the hwinfo developer and ""effective clocks"" vs ""discrete clocks"" and basically ignore core VID and core clock. Core clock is the most misleading stat as is core VID. The core VID is what is available to the chip, not what it is actually using. You have to scroll allllll the way down to ""CPU core VID (effective)"" to get the accurate voltage reading. And when doing so put it in context of which CCD is using said voltage. When both CCDs are loaded voltage will be below the maximum FIT voltage for high current loads. High current loads = a real sitaution where all cores are loaded.



As for Ryzen Master, I do not bother installing it. I've no use for it especially since it cannot overlay, so it's useless to me. Afterburner is a powerful too, even if you are not monitoring with it. You can use AB to check/confirm which apps are using HW acceleration. And then use that info copy/pasta into RTSS to create profiles to disallow X app from using HW acceleration, etc etc. Afterburner, RTSS, and HWINFO go hand in hand.

			Lots of good info from an AMD SME in this reddit post. It helped me when I first got my Ryzen 3700X. Here's a quote: ""Please note that it is totally normal for your Ryzen to use voltages in a range of 0.200V - 1.500V -- this is the factory operating range of the CPU. It is also totally normal for the temperature to cycle through 10°C swings as boost comes on and off. You will always see these characteristics, as they're intended, so do not be surprised to see such values.  ""

Again, im not shooting for the stars but id also like things to be correct.



Another point, yesterday when i tried to dial the voltage back a bit, my first attemp was to use override mode.  i entered 1.25v and restarted.  CPUz told me my voltage was stuck at 1.25 volts... there was no powering down happening when the system was idle.  So, if i were to just take #s from above, and enter 1.36 or whatever worked for others, i would most likely get a static voltage, and none of the power saves from having the voltage adapt to whats needed when a load is applied.  so from what i understand of how i did it the second time, with the -0.2v is that its still running in auto mode, trying to him its overly powerful limit of 1.47 stock, but im limiting it to 1.27v by using my offset.  all its auto stuff is working, and keeping the voltage low when the system is idle.  so, overall, a bit more explanation of what i actually need to change would be helpful.  thanks!



one other thing iv noticed in the shorty time the sytem h as been up, and even with my slightly reduced voltage, is the seeming insignificant amount of load it takes to make the temperature rise.  having task manager up, and HWinfo showing me the temp, it might float around 35c, and if i get a 5% load from windows it will jump up to... i dunno.. 44 or 48 or something higher, in a second.  for a seemingly trivial load, thats a rather large jump in temps, no?  like, if thats how much the temp goes up from some tiny background process, whats going to happen when i actually ask it to do some work?



and since i didnt say it above, im using a modest h100i pro corsair cooler.  worked well on my 5960x, which only ran at 1.3v OCd.  I dont think i ever broke 80c."

			Gotcha.  You're on;y going to see a  50% performance increase, for the cost of $2000 (just based on 1080p HEVC benchmarks).  But I will agree it's your best upgrade path.



I would possibly wait for Zen 3, but that's on you.  Most people are expecting the price to be identical, and the performance increase should be a lot closer to 2x than the 3950x.

Thanks!!  That's good advice.  I can't justify the cost for 50%.  What can I say, the 1950X build was my first build from scratch, all self taught and I'm hooked.  Pushing a 3.7Ghz overclock without water cooling.  I set the queue in Vidcoder and let the threadripper do its job.  Sometimes the queue is so packed, my system will encode around the clock for 3-4 days straight.  



Any idea when Zen 3 is rolling out?"

			In the video I posted, keeping an eye on the clocks - they will dip into the 3900MHz range.  We have no idea on ambient temps (that I saw).  It would appear that even excellent air cooling leaves a lot on the table.  If you are just doing gaming and light workloads, the 3950x probably isn't for you.  I would suggest a 3900x on air with the NH-D15.



If you can bite the bullet and go aio - there are some great options out there for the 3950x.  Kraken x72, Thermaltake Floe DX 360mm, corsair H150i Pro Hydro.  I think the H150i is the quietest of the bunch.

I get 4.1GHz all core running Blender with the Gooseberry test file. So, water cooling is giving me at least a 200MHz advantage. Mind you, the block isn't ideal (it's an older block) and the radiator is just a 360mm. I got about 4.15GHz on the 3900X under the same configuration. I think it's clear you leave performance on the table by reducing clocks. Clocks are important. It doesn't seem like much, but it does matter. Going up to 4.3GHz all core yields pretty decent gains. Just as single core boosting to 4.6GHz+ impacts games and other applications."

			You cant trust HWinfo 64 completely, as it cant detect cores that are put to sleep.



See this comparison of Ryzen Master vs HWinfo64 on my almost completely idle 3900X. HWinfo shows much higher clocks. HWinfo does not know the core has been powered down, so it'l show the last active clock.

The lower clocks on CCD0 are (AFAIK) cores that have been partially idle / sleeping during the sample period, that gives an average clock for the period.



View attachment 248326



Dont get me wrong, HWinfo is a very good program, and I use it a lot myself.



You just cant trust it completely as a tool for this kind of analysis.



Otherwise I have no comment to your endeavour about manually clocking the 3900x, I'm certain you can strike a good balance.

I leave my 3900x on auto,  and trust AMD to know what they are doing with the clocks and voltages.

FYI... You need to read the link I posted and then you'd learn that RM's algorithms are propriety and that AMD will not share how they calculate what they calculate, even though they worked with HWINFO.








	
	
		
		
			On Zen2 (Matisse) systems this method can provide results closer to Ryzen Master (RM) per-core clock values, especially because it respects sleeping cores. It is assumed that such cores are marked as sleeping by RM when the effective (average) clock is below a certain threshold (somewhere around 50 MHz and below). Please note, that RM uses a different (proprietary) technique to measure clocks, so there might be some differences between the effective clock in HWiNFO and RM. While we work with AMD on the best way to access more accurate data to measure clock and voltage values, this remains the only method. Additionally, the current effective clock method is an architectural feature meaning that it doesn't depend on a certain CPU model, but is rather universal across a broad range of CPU families.
		
		Click to expand...
	


And regarding sleep states, you just ignored that hole part. Scroll down.








	
	
		
		
			Another disadvantage is that cores in modern CPUs that have no workload are being suspended (lower C-States). In such case when software attempts to poll their status, it will wake them up briefly and thus the clock obtained doesn't respect the sleeping state.



Hence a new approach needs to be used called the Effective clock. This method relies on hardware's capability to sample the actual clock state (all its levels) across a certain interval, including sleeping (halted) states. The software then queries the counter over a specific polling period, which provides the average value of all clock states that occurred in the given interval. HWiNFO v6.13-3955 Beta introduces reporting of this clock.

I am not overthinking this. Before my last (still operational) system, my previous 2 motherboards had failed prematurely (about 2 years each) due to poor motherboard temperature/power management. Both failed on the motherboard voltage regulator section, with failed power supply/regulator capacitors. The failed capacitors are easy to spot - the top of the larger filter capacitors should be flat, but they get swollen and bubble up when they fail.



Heat stress/cycling ages parts very quickly. In fact, that's exactly how we ""age"" our electronics in our lab to calculate how many years they will be operational for - We put our electronics in a temperature controlled oven, and rapidly heat/freeze the boards to ""age"" them. There are well-defined mathematical models to support how heat and temperature stressing ages components.



The only reason I upgraded to my new system was to get more processing cores for real-time video transcoding in Plex, which my previous system was starting to struggle with when streaming 4k  HDR videos. I also run multiple Virtual Machines simultaneously, so more processing power could be handy.



Other than that, my previous motherboard/CPU wasn't ""obsolete"" - it worked perfectly fine for most of the modern gaming and general processing for my usage. My GPUs did need to be replaced every few years, due failure from their very high operating temperature under load, but my motheboard was fine. Did I get the maximum FPS gaming at the maximum settings with my previous system? No. I can't get the maximum with some games on my new system, either. But was I able to play the games? Absolutely.



I don't replace my cell phones until they die, either (which generally means I can't replace the battery anymore). Improvements in cell phones are minimal at this point in time, and my 3 year old OnePlus 3T with its replaced battery is still chugging along fine. I get maximum lifetime out of my cell phones by declocking and charging the phone once every 3 days or so.



I am not a user who replaces their system every 2-3 years, which is wasteful - and with minimal performance improvement. I can't imagine where 12 cores/24 threads will be obsolete anytime soon. I want this system to last for 7-10 years, just like my last one, so I am taking the steps now while the parts are young to lower temperature swings / stress.

I haven't run Gooseberry on the newer versions of Blender. I'm running 2.79b on Windows. 2.80 I think it is was considerably faster when I tested it. That's also on Linux, so I'm not sure they are directly comparable. However, I have run it before and the time in that video seems slow to me. I'd have to run the newer test to confirm. I'm seeing temperatures of around 80-85 degrees on full custom water cooling in Blender on a simple 4.3GHz overclock. On air, your going to see either higher temps or throttling of clock speeds to keep the temperatures lower. The way boost clocks work, the warmer your CPU is, the worse it performs. It may be adequate to air cool it with good air coolers but that's hardly ideal. Your leaving performance on the table by sticking with air cooling. When you've spent a decent amount on a motherboard and $750 on a processor, that doesn't make sense to me.

AMD doesn't include an air cooler because they realize that the cooler packaged with the 3900X wasn't up to the task. So, why does AMD state this? Well, companies like AMD and Intel are usually conservative with their recommendations. Meaning, top tier air cooling is probably fine (though I'd still argue it isn't ideal). However, they can't count on the general public choosing good air cooling. The statement is made probably because air flow, ambient temperatures and other factors in average builds may be problematic for achieving boost clock targets. Recommending something that's better on the cooling front ensures that users get the advertised performance and results that are in line with reviews and user data on forums and so on. 



Boost clocking is determined by a number of factors. CPU temperature being one of the key factors that determines how often boost clocks can be achieved. Dissipating 250w of heat is not an easy task for an air cooler. There is ""getting by"" and doing it well."

So I'm looking to assemble a new pc for the purpose of a home server. Looking for recommendations for the CPU. 

Obviously the market is currently leaning in favor of AMD when it comes to price for performance, so I've been looking primarily at AMD's offerings. 



I'm right now looking at the Ryzen 3 3200, and the Ryzen 5 3400. If you have any other suggestions, I'm open to those as well. 



The server will be acting primarily as a file server/NAS, and will be running Ubuntu server. But I am a net admin and a dev, so I will likely also make it a LAMP server, plex server, and will be using it as a seed box, among whatever else I feel like doing. I don't think I'll be needing dedicated graphics, so I will probably just stick with the onboard graphics provided by both. 



Money is not a concern, but I don't like wasting money and don't want to buy anything that will be overkill for my needs.

The Zen 3 based 4700x should be 5-10% faster than the 9900k in games.



The 10900k  is just a 9900k with 2 cores added, and 300 mhz higher speed.  The core architecture is the same as the 9900k, so you just get a 5% performance bump from the clock speed increase.  The extra cores will do nothing in current games.



Zen 3 is the best value for gaming coming out..  While the 3700x does deliver 20% faster performance in productivity apps, it's only a 10% increase in most games.  Most people assume it's the CCX latency plus external memory controller  that's slowing things up, and the CCX iis being remove with Zen 3.  you're also getting the same amount of L3 cache as is currently in the 3950x in a single 8-core (which should calm the high latency memory).  That should be enough to more than  make up the gaming-only IPC deficit currently suffered by Zen  2  (and every other app should see a similar increase).



See here for a 4ghz 8-core IPC comparison. The 3700x is not a slam dunk upgrade for your 2700x, but waiting for Zen 3 almost certainly would be:

			I let HWInfo run for a few hours last night while I was doing things like gaming, editing, etc.



Here is what I have: 


	


As you can see, I have two cores that hit 4.5 Ghz, two that hit 4.4 Ghz, 5 that hit 4.3 Ghz. The rest are lower than that. I was doing a ton of stuff, from gaming to editing, to rendering audio and video, etc. Would it be correct to assume that if I have these numbers for several hours of use, they could be the maximums of these cores?



You'll also see that average voltage applied throughout this time was just under 1.4 volts which my brain still says is a lot.



I did even more testing today, going from stock to the profile that I mentioned here (4.2 all core @ 1.275v). Here are my findings:




TempPeak SpeedPeak CPU Power %Average VoltsTDC%EDC%Cine ScoreStockIdle4415.51.412218Cine724.1115 (not a mistake)1.37961007108RM Profile (4.2 @1.275v)Idle42181.0934Cine664.295.41.27517237307


As you can see, I have small gains both in peak speed as well as Cine Score. However, these small gains are happening with lower temperatures when running Cinebench, likely due to the big difference in volts being sent to the CPU.



So, for everyday computing it seems like this profile would likely be a good balance between speed, power, and temperature, thus fan quietness.



My next step would be to look into overclocking by CCD or CCX, particularly to get better speeds for gaming. A few days ago, I was playing Red Dead Redemption 2 and streaming to Twitch via OBS and my fans were running at either full speed or very close to it, The case was very loud, so loud that I could hear it through my headphones while playing the game although I use open back phones.



I have to add that I have never seen the current speed at 4.5 or 4.4 Ghz. If these cores are hitting those speeds, they are for very brief moments and they do not do it frequently. Taking this into consideration, would it make that much of a real-world difference if I managed to clock some of these cores at 4.5 Ghz or 4.4 Ghz via CCD or CCX manual speed settings? We're only talking about 7% here...

No, this is stock behavior, there is no point to watching the voltage threshold for this. When you are ascertaining the maximum FIT voltage for high current load, it is a specific process of maxing PBO and letting it do its thing. We are also not using Cinebench, as Cionebench is NOT hard to run, it does not even pass as a stability test. I run Prime which loads the hell out of the cpu. Then watch your voltage.

Sorry, you are looking at it wrong. When using hwinfo the average volts is not a good indicator of volts at all. When the cpu raises volts to the 1.45v-1.5v region, it happens for milliseconds in everyday use. This will skew average volts. You also cannot compare an allcore setting with stock which is what you are doing. The 4.2ghz allcore will be faster than the base clock.

Wrong again, as you are running an overclock with RM with a lower set voltage that will keep your chip from hitting the much needed single core boost. People, you all need to understand the voltage reporting is limited because it cannot show who where the voltage is going. If you are lucky enough to have a second CCD you can then see if the voltage being shown is actually going to the whole chip or the CCD that is currently running a low current load, ie. single core/single thread. This is why the average volts is useless to us except in cases where you reset the counter to get the average within a specific time, like when you are benching. For everyday computing you are losing single core/thread boosting to 4.6ghz so that to me is not ideal. Allcore overclocks are ideal for everyday use if everyday you spend all your time in Cinebench, otherwise stock is an obvious good compromise. If you want to maximize perf period, then a ratio overclock will net you the performance of an allcore while keeping one CCX higher clocked to still get that precious single core/thread boosting. For ex... note the multi vs single scoring.

			You guys should consider running a ratio overclock. Generally speaking the first chiplet can run 4.5ghz at 1.325v or there abouts. Thus running an allcore at 4.3 means you lose out on that precious single core boost. Setting a ratio of 4.5 for the first CCX and 4.3 for the other CCX, gets you that allcore performance you want and a good compromise for single thread performance.



For example 4.3 all core

ratio overclock 4.45 to 4.3

For example last Dec I built a serious workstation with the 3970x. I could have run it at 4.1ghz to 4.2ghz but then we'd lose the precious single core boosting. That is seriously important even in a heavy crunching machine like that because single core boost is massively crucial in the prep stages of an app like Adobe before you get to the rendering stage, ie. many parts of AfterEffects for example are single threaded before you get to rendering.

A Thermalright HR-02 Macho Rev.A bought in 2013 ( http://www.thermalright.com/product/macho-rev-abw/ ) but im concerned it wont perform well due to 3900x IHS and different die size compared to older chips. Macho Rev.A also has a convex base and i'm not sure if this could be a thing.



As I want to restrain my budget on this one I'd prefer to keep one of those 2 but I'll buy one if needed.

			No way. Custom loop maybe but no AIO will cool better than the setup I have...Thermalright Silver Arrow TR4 with dual 140mm Noctua Chromax fans running full speed.  During video encoding with Vidcoder, every core of the 1950X is pushing about 100%.  Maybe in less cpu intensive tasks.  I have experimented with the volts for a long time and cannot push more than 1.24 (1.23750) volts without temps passing 68C.  Pushing the 1950X past 3.7Ghz at this voltage results in an unstable overclock, not even 3.8Ghz.  I originally started with the Enermax Liqtech TR4 360.  Total garbage...Went through two and both leaked and didn't cool better than my setup now even before they weren't leaking.  I've seen people boast 3.9-4.1Ghz overclocks online.  I don't know what applications they are using but the way Vidcoder pushes every core of the 1950X, averaging 230 watts can't keep the temps lower than 68C.  Even with my current overclock the temps get up to 71C when the ambient room temp is warm.

Why are you worried about staying that cool?  It should be fine up to 85C (and above, but those are temps people usually shoot for).



As to the original question, I went from a 1920X to 3950X, it was a very large jump and I got decent money for the tr4 setup on the used market.  I reused the psu, ram and cooler (the corsair aio has mounts for both tr4 and am4) so total cost was only around $400."

This is not true. The Acer X34 Predator can do 120Hz via overclocking the panel. This feature is accessible in it's menus. My Alienware has the same panel if I recall correctly. It works great. Aside from that, the 3950X is just fine for gaming, if not better than anything AMD has for that purpose by virtue of its boost clocks being the highest of any CPU it offers. That said, I agree. The 3960X is better in just about every other way, but you pay for that extra performance. The CPU alone is about double the price and the motherboard's cost of entry is quite a bit higher. Then of course, you need four DIMMs to enable quad-channel memory support. Your cooling solution will also need to be a lot beefier to handle a 24c/48t CPU."

The question is monitoring temps all that important once you figure out what your config is? I set it, do some baselining, and uninstall everything afterwards now.

			Messing around yesterday, either my chip is a complete dog or I'm really screwing things up.  I tried some overclocking with Ryzen Master.  I couldn't complete a CB20 run at 4.3 all core at even 1.3875v.  I dialed things back to 1.35, and clocked the chiplets separately.  The best I could do was 4.35 GHz on the good chiplet and 4.25 GHz on the bad chiplet.  Anything higher will not finish a CB20 run.  I then ran Prime 95 at those settings and the computer rebooted after about 5 minutes.  Also, temps are completely fine at all of these settings.  Never out of the 60s.  What am I doing wrong?

Looks like you got GoldChain shitlet and he got your good chiplet. Kidding aside, try OCing individual cores in Ryzen Master to see which one is limiting you plus figure out which CCD you can OC more. It maybe just one limiting core or CCD. One Chiplet I can OC to around 4.3x and the other 4.5x.

			You're completely wrong. Allcore boost will only run the voltage it needs, and that situation is a high current load which is around 1.325v maximum. My 3900x for example runs up to 1.25v for a 3900mhz allcore boost on stock. How is that too much voltage??? Whenever you see 1.4v+ under vcore, using hwinfo, you can then see which CCD is heated up. That will tell you whether its single core or not. As BOTH CCD will never be heated up when vcore is showing more than 1.4v. Whenever the chip shows 1.4v+ it is in a low current load, ie. single thread/core.



Also this suggestion that it's one setting for all is bogus as heck. The algorithms that AMD has developed are not one size fits all. Every chip will have it's own unique behavior driven by the chips thousand sensors.

Is it possible that PBO is ramping up cpu speeds, temps, and fan speeds?  I have read about PBO but could not understand the technical details in threads about it.

use the bios to set a custom fan curve; flat 25-30% until 55C the ramp to 100% at 80c. that will stop the up/down. it will do it with any hsf if you dont set a custom curve. if you want less noise and lower temps upgrade to at minimum a 120mm tower cooler."

pendragon1 - I don't see these spikes occurring on the motherboard's LED temperature display when I have the PC in the BIOS Setup pages. I agree with Furious_Styles that the BIOS is probably running a fixed (and probably very minimal) clock speed to assure valid operation in the BIOS. I can say that the motherboard's LED display quickly goes down to the ambient system temperature while I am in the BIOS (about 3 DegC lower than system idle).

And, yes - I did indeed see the temperature spikes with the clean install ... which was very frustrating.

- normal windows usage - no real difference

Games (1440p, dual monitors)

- FPS: some, not much really (although better overall). with some exceptions where the difference was quite visible

Stability during gaming 

- less intensive games - not visible impr. (did not have issues before )

- intensive gamesverall, no more stuttering. Division 2: no more hiccups during gaming (had the fps, but any background activity would trigger stutter); CIv (modded, late game): no more stutters after  round transition is over; similar with Cities Skyline (although fps impr was not much)

It may sound disappointing buuut:

- i don't need to close the browser(s) any more (many tabs, youtube and so on), background programs (eg a torrent client downloading and/or uploading), in general, unless there is a ram issues, everything runs in the background fine > no more stuterring (including during Division)

Alt-Tab - from any game (intensive or not) is instant (again, when ram is not the problem). High speed downloads/ uploads, program updates, windows updates no longer visible while gaming

I can forget a running city (in city skyline) in the background without noticing it* (in need to stress how intensive Skylines can be with some public traffic overlays, over modded, while zoomed in on a massive public transportation node, at high speed )

*have a kraken over gpu, no real noise increase during usage



TLDR: 

not much improvement over FPS values, but massive improvement over random stutters, and overall usage (multiple browsers and/or browser windows vs video players vs netflix app vs games vs background)

- as long as ram is not a problem, i no longer need to close everything/ anything in background

- Alt-tab is a breeze, no more waiting, no more black screens, no more stutters after going back to game."

While I am sure there is a bottleneck when using the external GPU via TB, it is not as nearly bad as you make it out to be.



I'm glad to see AMD doing this well in the laptop segment. My other laptop with a 2700u Ive found to be capable. I can only imagine how a 4900 and a dedicated gpu would work together.

your ram speed is low because its operating at the default jdec speed. you have to manually set it to 3200 or enable xmp.

Doing some further research, I think you might have a bad processor.  I did 18hrs of testing yesterday usiing Ryzen Master and didn't have any spiking like I did before setting the values manually.  I set the 12 core/12 thread profile up to 4500 and it was stable in C20 for and hour, no fluctuations.  But at that speed I was seeing it go up to almost 120w usage with the temp in low 80c on an Arctic Liquid Freezer II - 280.





.  At that speed but with 12c/24t it was hitting almost 140 watts at 92-97c.  But again, nothing was bouncing up and down like a squirrel on crack. Of course I turned it down since seeing those results. That's why after this I feel you either have a bad chip or the motherboard can't regulate the power to be stable enough to have a more constant, normal setting.



I am surprised I am keeping things really rock solid stable since I bought a cheaper motherboard than I usually do:

Lets us know if you find the culprit or if it is in fact defective setup.

If I do this build when the next AMD cpu comes out at the end of the year I can just drop it in correct? I'm also just gaming on this this system nothing else.

Go for it now.  Get 2x Firecuda 2GB Nvme with 4000-5500mb speeds and don't look back.  You can upgrade to the 4000 series later to boot.

Don't ever wait on what might be.  DDR5 is 2 to 3 years away from being in the same affordable class as DDR4 is now.  All new memory has been expensive.

This is [H]ardocp, not softOcp n' wait to see.  You have the money to burn now, do it.  What you waiting for, Covid19?  Enjoy now.

I have that Sabrent Rocket Nvme drive.  It is great speed wise, but I am concerned about longevity of it.  If the FireCuda drive was around then, I would have bought that instead.



Personally I have noticed  Microcenter running out of CPU stock and of course Newegg inflating prices do to B&M not having stock.  Going to get my little Ryzen 3600 with motherboard on Friday.  When money allows I will get the 3900x or wait till 4900x.  Right now my Z170 doesn't have another M2 slot to support my other Nvme drive, and its getting long in the tooth.  My 6700k has been a good chip, but it is time to upgrade the platform as a whole.  Can't wait, been since the Phenom days since I had an AMD anything."

It depends on the game.  I run a lot of vr games and they need 90fps for frame minimums. In dx11 games, that often hammers the cpu on a single thread with draw calls as they are doubled vs 2d, meaning zen and zen+ often struggle in high scene complexity, even at 4ghz.

			I just don't know of many uses cases that are going to saddle a high end GPU with a mobile 8 core cpu (at best).  If you're doing that type of compute, you're likely going to want to feed it with a high end, high power cpu.  I'm not sure what your use case is, but a $2000 desktop you can upgrade in stages and $500 laptop you carry around for 3-5 years might be a much more effective setup than a $1500 laptop and $1000 egpu enclosure setup...And the storage can be directly attached to the desktop motherboard, no need to saddle yourself with TB3.

If you look at Nvidias mobile GPU numbers, they are making a killing, and A LOT of those systems are paired up with expensive Intel CPUs toward the middle/high end of the stack. A significant number of working gamers that make real money need a laptop and want the best they can get inside the power envelope of mobile.  This has been an absolute cash cow segment for Intel and Nvidia for a long time, and AMD has forever been trying to get back into the fight on either end.

we have a word for the decimal representation of bits ... it's called kilobits, megabits, gigabits, terabits, etc.  This is often used to measure transferrate / bandwidth.  Not size since bits are stored in bytes and bytes are base 2. 



It's a difference in storage vs transfer. Storage has always been represented as bytes and bytes have always been represented as forms of base 2 numbers because of the physical way it's stored.  software represents it correctly, only storage manufacturers use their own stupid definition. 



Storage manufacturers had their marketing teams decide that numbers that dont end in zero's are too complicated for the public and they could say they were XYZ Megabytes when in fact they were less if they just redefined what a megabyte was.   So they did.   



This is fully and intentionally misleading because a consumer who is told by software, correctly, that they need say 1GB for a certain application and that consumer goes out to buy a 1GB drive will think the drive is large enough but in fact, they're buying a 0.93GB drive. 



Later on new terms were created for the traditional <term>byte names to represent the correct way to use bytes since nobody could get storage companies to correct their definition.  This is called the kibibyte, mebibyte, gibibyte, tebibyte.  But it takes a long time for these things to get adopted by software and society as a whole. 

 

We technically should never refer to basically anything as megabyte or terabyte since it's only a term used by hdd manufacturers to sell drives.  Everywhere else uses the measurement that would refer to the new ebi and ibi terms."

			There were rumors about Zen 2 having at least one part with 16 cores and hitting clock speeds of 5.0GHz or better. These were absolutely unfounded. I can't believe anyone fell for that in the first place.



The thing is, AMD is doing allot with Zen 2. They are increasing core counts and IPC substantially. The fact that they managed to increase clock speeds at all is actually something of a miracle while doing everything else. 12 cores and 4.6GHz boost clocks speeds with a 105 watt TDP is quite impressive. The thing is, its extremely difficult to increase clock speeds, keep the old TDP and improve IPC. Generally IPC improvements and clock speed increases don't happen together at all, much less to the massive degree the rumor suggested. That's why I never believed it.



That said, we do not know what, if any overclocking headroom these CPU's have. My guess is that they'll have next to no headroom and the best we can hope for is to level the boost clock across all the cores at once much like we do with Threadripper and Ryzen 2000 series CPU's now. We might even have to drop slightly below the boost clock to do that, but we'll see. I'm still trying to get sampled on these things.

But still all the info out there seems to point to the eventual release of the 16/32 chip. AMD would be foolish to play their whole card right now as they currently have the upper hand and intel doesn't have much of an answer.

			I have to think that's pretty good for a 3970X on air--are your room ambient temps pretty low too?  Just to be clear, when you say stock, you mean at straight 3.8 MHz?  I've been chasing this low temp ghost on my 3960X and so many variables seem to play into the equation, like the default motherboard bios setups which on mine (zenith II extreme) include a lot of ""performance"" and precision boosting settings on auto.  I always considered ""stock"" not touching any settings, but that's just not the case anymore I think.  Turning those off to a straight 3.8 MHz (the base clock stock), I'm idling at 35 C with the TR edition of the Thermaltake Floe Riing 360.  When I run the Prime95 small FFTs for the maximum power, I'm getting to 81 C as well and on the smallest FFTs getting to 75 C.  I see Asus is looking at releasing a 420mm TR aio, so there may be a new crop of coolers more suited to the new TR coming out over the next year.

Yes no tuning at all. just running the stock Clock speeds as per the stock settings on the MB.  3.8 Mz...  The room temp is 21C with radiant floor heating.  Right now the new PC is on the floor in  the family room by the TV and the Fireplace.  Oh and I used the stock thermal paste that came with the Noctua cooler too.. 13 blobs of it as per the instructions.  9 little blobs with 4 larger ones in between  

The RAM is getting warm though..  it is simply 8 sticks of 8G Vengeance 3000Mhz that I had kicking around.  



The fan(s) on the Noctua cooler are very close to the RAM and I had to move the fan so it sits proud of the cooler fins by about 1/4""  (7mm)



The PRIME TRx40-Pro MB is marketed by ASUS as one that can be over clocked BUT it is the low end MB and most of the reviews recommend to pick others to use for overclocking for fear of overheating the VRM which has marginal cooling."

The 3900X was faster in almost every single test. Often by quite a large margin. I have no doubt this would translate to the 1950X and the 3950X. In fact, the gap is likely slightly larger as the 2000 series Threadrippers saw some improvements over their 1000 series predecessors. 



The biggest place you'll see a difference is in anything requiring single-threaded performance. Gaming is a great example of this. The extra L3 cache and the topology of the processor are all designed to help mitigate the latency penalties earlier processors had regarding crossing CCX boundaries."

			This is not true. The Acer X34 Predator can do 120Hz via overclocking the panel. This feature is accessible in it's menus. My Alienware has the same panel if I recall correctly. It works great. Aside from that, the 3950X is just fine for gaming, if not better than anything AMD has for that purpose by virtue of its boost clocks being the highest of any CPU it offers. That said, I agree. The 3960X is better in just about every other way, but you pay for that extra performance. The CPU alone is about double the price and the motherboard's cost of entry is quite a bit higher. Then of course, you need four DIMMs to enable quad-channel memory support. Your cooling solution will also need to be a lot beefier to handle a 24c/48t CPU.

Absolutely nope on 120hz.



Maybe the 2019 version can but I have the first release of this panel. If there is some firmware update method I'd love to know how.



I got mine in 2016 I believe

			Do you game? If so how did you find the move from 3950x to 3960x? I'm looking to buy one of these (finally moving away from X58), and am seriously considering the 3960x as I also do a lot of compiling and the TRX40 looks more future-proof, but I also want something that performs well for 144Hz gaming and also VR (so again up to 144Hz double frames).
		
		Click to expand...
	
Gaming is very enjoyable. As a true measure of cpu performance one game I play A LOT is Titanfall 2. I have a 240hz monitor. The game is frame locked at 144hz. Howeever using some vsync tricks in my 2080ti control panel I can get game to unlock fps. With titanfall 2 @ 1080p maximum settings possible I tegularly hold 220+ fps.



My oculus rift is frame maxed at 90fps per eye regardless of title.



I also play at 3440x1440p on my Acer x34. Now at this very hi res we all know gpu is the main part but every last game I can throw at it runs @ 100fps which is my gsync fps max.



The 3960x has 128mb of l3 cache which is insane. Last night as a matter of fact I was playing Titanfall 2 at 220 to 230fps avg ultra settings and running 2 handbrake h265 encodes at the same time without a glitch.



3950x is a nice chip but as I have said before, the 3960x runs circles around it overall.



And yes the 3960 is a workstation CPU and is a different segment. I get that.



Of course you also need to consider that a 3950x is just as fast if not a bit faster in games due to its slightly higher clock speed. But it runs significantly hotter due to the tiny IHS to die ratio and so the differences are negatively impacted. For the 3960 its the high price that offsets it. Both are a waste if all.your gonna do is game with them. If all your doing is pure gaming save a whole cow load of cash and get a 3600 and spend the rest of your cash on a badass GPU and some very fast 3600 c16 or 18 ram that can be tightened to 15ns.

			No, it is still the same. But I do not think it is a bug. To my understanding it is normal behaviour with 3600, it is a poor low binned CPU that requires more voltage than better pinned CPU's just to be 100% stable. Undervolting comes with a measurable performance penalty.



That said, I also use -.05v undervolt because the penalty is almost nonexistent in real life use but the temperature reduction is quite big.

After reading more on this and testing it myself (turning off PBO and looking at temps vs performance, I've decided that leaving everything stock in the BIOS - and keeping the CPU as cool as possible - is going to give the best performance to heat ratio. These CPUs are not like the old school. Reporting software doesn't seem to tell the whole story when we start messing with voltages. However, Cine 20 will. I turned off PBO, got 2C better temps, and in Cine, dropped performance - not much, but noticeable.



So, I was never going to OC this rig anyway. It doesn't need to be any faster, although cooler is always good, less noise, for one."

Exactly. Its a sensational headline which generates clicks and traffic. The fact is, CPU's do not typically improve that much from generation to generation. At least, not these days. Anyone who thinks otherwise doesn't have a solid grasp of how chip development works. Back when there was a focus on the desktop with performance being the goal and TDP not making much of a difference, things were different. Back in the Pentium days we saw rapid clock speed increases but we weren't anywhere near the limits of what we could do with silicon and the modern PC as we knew it, was practically in its infancy. In the early days of a technology, more rapid improvement is to be expected. Once you reach a certain level of advancement, the improvements come at a much slower pace. These days we are at a clock speed wall and are struggling to make the transistors smaller. The focus is on efficiency and performance per watt. 



With that focus and the limitations of current silicon, you can't expect an 800MHz clock speed increase with everything else that was done just isn't realistic."

			Actually - Since I do hardware qualification on electronics, the reason I am trying to get this spiking resolved is because this constant temperature spiking causes wear and tear on the motherboard components and the CPU.



I always aim to reduce component ""idle"" temperatures as much as possible, since I plan to hold onto this motherboard for the next 7+ years (like I did with my previous Core i7 3770 system that still works absolutely perfectly).



This temperature spiking may be considered ""normal"" or ""within tolerance"" by AMD, but constant temperature cycling / demand peaks will reduce the lifetime of the motherboard power section components (primarily, the capacitors) and the CPU.



A lot of folks upgrade their systems every few years. I don't.



I don't experiment with overclocking for the same reason. The last water-cooled system I overclocked was dead in under two years due to a motherboard component failure.



I spent a lot of bux on my system and I want it to be viable for as long as possible, so I want my idle temperatures low and stable.

How do I know this? I'm lucky enough that my MSI X570 ACE motherboard has a built-in temperature LED display on the motherboard that I can use to monitor my temperature. The LED display is driven through the BIOS, and not by Windows software. When in the BIOS alone, I never see any temperature spikes occurring.



Also, HWInfo64 appears to be benign, and doesn't trigger the Ryzen temperature spikes (not all board monitors can claim this). Whether or not HWInfo64 is running or not, the frequency of the Win10 temp spikes occur at the same rate. Additionally, HWInfo64 and the MSU motherboard LED displays track each other flawlessly. I can't say the same for Ryzen Master, which appears to be significantly filtering out these temperature spikes.



Most folks say that these spikes are normal. It's true that almost everybody sees them now, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't be fixed.

			I am just curious.  Why is everyone trying to figure out why the chip does this anyways.   It seems to affect every 3000 series chip and seems to be something in Windows that causes the cyclic frequency bounces on the CPU thus the temps.  I have had my 3900x since August and to be honest have never even really noticed this after I set proper fan curves.  Then again I also do not stare are HWInfo64 24/7 to even see it happening.  Just wondering why you all sit and wonder what is going on here and spend sop much time trying to figure out how to stop it.

			One thing I definitely wouldn't buy now is mobo. You've got B550 coming out, then presumably we will see X670 launch when Zen 3 actually drops.  At that time re-evaluate all the options.  You also don't have to deal with potential BIOS issues.



The other stuff you mentioned wouldn't hurt to pick up now.  I personally hate sitting on new components for months.  You might not be able to test if something is DOA, and you'll have to RMA to manufacturer rather than exchange with Amazon/Newegg/etc... There might be better deals down the line, especially once we get closer to being out of this pandemic.  I would only pick up things if it's a really good deal.  Keep an eye on here in the deals section and use slickdeals.



This will also give you time to research the ""best"" PCIe 4.0 NVME SSD (I personally would just get a Sabrent Rocket on PCIe 3.0 and call it a day... lol 3500Mbps read is fast enough for me and I'd even go back to using a SATA SSD and it wouldn't kill me). Zen 2 can usually handle 3733MHz RAM give or take, so I hope Zen 3 has improved IMC so might pay to hold off to see what kit works best.  Hoping for 4000MHz achievable but that's probably more wishful thinking than anything.  You don't want to be stuck with 3200MHz RAM that can't clock high if Zen 3 can push RAM.

I've seen some back and fourth on that depending on the game. It also depends on the model. The lower end parts like the 3600X and 3700X seem to benefit more from manual overclocking due to their lower boost clocks. The 3900X and 3950X benefit less from doing that outside of a few rare applications and games."

		Click to expand...
	
Sure, but the F-ers start to get noisy after 50% or 1000 RPM. So, what I am trying to do is see how far I can push the fan profile at 50% speed and still keep the CPU under 75C. One of my problem  is the lakl of risers, and I have my case fans hooked to the only available riser, which so happen to be hooked to the AIO fans, which ahve a max RPM of 2000. Now, this wouldn't be a problem except the case fans, Noctua 140mm Redex, max RPMs are 1200. So when I dial down the AIO to 50%, the Noc fans are only spinning 600RPMs. I'm thinking about putting the noc fans on a manual controller (4 140s) and setting them to about 1000 RPM, which is silent. Hopefully that will supply case with enough cool air that the AIO, which is in the case out mode, that is, sucks air from inside the case, will have cooler air and won't have to ramp up as soon. 



However, I'm moving the AIO to the front of the case, and the fans will be sucking air from the outside and pushing through the Radiator TO the inside. Either way, keeping the inside as cool as posible will help keep the AIO fans from having to open up sooner than later.



I just want to keep the AIO fans running at below 1000 RPMs as long as possible."

I'm not sure if the temperatures are okay or a bit too high and I should reapply TIM again (I did whole CPU surface thermal paste spread method).

Yes and watching youtube is not idle activity. There is quite a bit of video decompression happening in the CPU from the YT stream. Any spike in a core will generate heat. Idle is like sitting there not watching, listening, or even moving the mouse. Even then background processes prevent true idle. Chip is always working.



My 3960x performs exactly the same as you are explaining.

Even with absolutely nothing installed on a fresh Win10 installation, I see periodic 8 to 10 DegC (around 36 DegC => 46 DegC) spontaneous temperature spikes once every 10 seconds or so.



Does anybody know what in Win10 is causing these temperature spikes? I know that the new Ryzen CPUs are more sensitive to core boosting, but I would really like to get my system running cooler with less of these temperature spikes.

			Messing around yesterday, either my chip is a complete dog or I'm really screwing things up.  I tried some overclocking with Ryzen Master.  I couldn't complete a CB20 run at 4.3 all core at even 1.3875v.  I dialed things back to 1.35, and clocked the chiplets separately.  The best I could do was 4.35 GHz on the good chiplet and 4.25 GHz on the bad chiplet.  Anything higher will not finish a CB20 run.  I then ran Prime 95 at those settings and the computer rebooted after about 5 minutes.  Also, temps are completely fine at all of these settings.  Never out of the 60s.  What am I doing wrong?
		
		Click to expand...
	
When I get home from work ill try and post some tips and just some general rules I followed when trying to push my chip. I am not sure that I am doing it right... but its working ok so far. I have trying really hard to get stable at 4.6ghz even on just on set of cores and its not happening even at crazy voltages. It appears my chip hits some kind of power usage threshold and shits the bed. Raising my voltage just brings it to that envelope quicker, doesn't really seem to help with the OC much. One thing I like about my board is it has an AMD overclocking voltage setting that lets me dial it up and down by .1mv so I can do 1.34 or 1.35 and it kind helps me keep it on the lower end of what I think is acceptable for voltage.



I recently installed the newest Beta Bios for my MEG ACE x570 and really didnt see any difference in PBO or any of that junk.



I think there is something to be explored with the way that the BIOS is telling the OS what the fastest core is, and the preferred power preferences which the setting name escapes me right now. But I have tried to use Ryzen master, and its idea of stable is a joke. It wont finish Cinabench R20 with Ryzen master stable. So I have no idea what its doing to determine that.



Just from what I have seen you should be able to get a R20 run out of 1.325v at a 43x multi, I think 1.35v all core is too high for anything under 4.35ghz , again this is relating back to that total power window I am seeing with my chip. So once the chip fully loads up, there is some voltage magic happening behind the scenes that I just cannot figure out. Everything gives a slightly different read and the pins on the board do not explain how the chip is using the voltage its being given. One of the biggest things that was causing my OC to fail for the CPU wasnt the CPU at all, it turned out I was having some issues with Memory and timings. I have some G-Skill Trident 4233 19 19 19 36 the RBG kind. Which is B Die. I dial it back to 3800 and set my Fabric to 1900, ANYTHING over 1900 on my fabric causes weird crashes, and anything under 1700 with higher ram speeds will also cause my system to crash. So I am not sure if its a total golden silicon situation or if its all about finding the perfect balance of timings/stability. XMP isnt worth using unless your kit is a 3200 or 3600 kit. The sub timings be set to auto are just garbage most times. I used the Ryzen D-Ram Calculator to get a good baseline and then sort of tweaked to stability.



I guess kind of for testing, I would set your fabric to something reasonable like 1800 and ram to 3600, it looks like your Fabric was around 1866 or something in that higher range. Also try 16 , 16, 16 across the board on those times you listed above. I notice your running cl16 with 15tras and 15 row timings. I have never had luck with my CL timing being higher than my refresh timings, I dont know how Ryzen would judge that latency wise or how the controller reacts. Row cycle time should be good around 42 to 46 i would think at those speeds. Or get the Ryzen D-Ram calc and try that out and see where fast puts you.





Also just make sure PBO is off, mine was on auto and it was actually lowering my CB scores with whatever my bois was doing with it. I also disable Cool and Quite.

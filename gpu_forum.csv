			I am testing Company of Heroes 2 @ 720p(integer scaling) and 1440p.



My setup is an X5470(about on par with i5-2400) and GTX 1650(low profile) 8GB RAM.



I used integer scaling @ 720p because the 1650 is not a 1440p card at all. But performance sucked. 24fps minimum and about 40fps average.



Then I tried 1440p and whoah... Still around 40fps avg, but 30 fps minimum!!! What the hell?



Does this mean my CPU is bottlenecking my GPU? But regardless, shouldnt low res in such a case increase performance anywhay?



And i5-2400 is plenty for CoH2 anyway, no?

			Alternative suggestion:  Optimization for new hardware takes time too - so they're finding more things that they can do on the 2XXX that they couldn't on the 1XXX, and the 1000-series is already had most of its optimizations.  (Also, the game devs have more time to find tricks/things they can do they couldn't before, and better tuning, etc).  See:  Consoles, early games vs later ones in terms of quality.  Once you figure out tricks to make the hardware do more than it could before, you use those. 



Now I agree Nvidia probably isn't investing time on the 1xxx series cards anymore, but there's more to that story too - multiple actors, if you will.

			What's happening in the GPU market?   My last purchase was a 1080TI FE back in 3/2017 for $699 back then and I'm not seeing any compelling reason to upgrade.  It looks like the AMD alternative is the RX5700 XT and Nvidia's is the RTX 2080TI.   The AMD might match the 1080TI but still might be a bit behind and the 2080TI can beat it but costs $1200+ for what I consider a modest performance gain.  Are we in  the same type of market that we were with Intel CPU's in the years before Ryzen?   No reason to upgrade until multiple generations of GPU improvements?

Moore's Law died in like 2011. From December 2011-April 2016 we were stuck on 28nm, rather than the typical 2 year node cadence previously. So that was basically 5.5 years stuck on 28nm.



Nvidia is finally dropping a node later this year in 3rd QTR 2020, around a 4.5 year cadence. A little quicker than 28nm, but we were basically stuck for close to 5 years. Sure if felt quicker, because they kept renaming the node from 20nm to 16nm to 12 nm, but in reality the transistor size was actually the same so we were effectively on the same node the entire time."

			You have more than one PCIE slot on there? Do yourself a favor, install both, on the older card do not put a power cable into it (it should still read and get power, otherwise use a pcie adapter if  you have one), in the other slot install the new card. Go into bios and see if it detects both cards.

Most graphics cards will not function at all without the power cables plugged in, even with power from the motherboard.  There are a few  (GTX 690 being one) that will show a nice friendly message to this effect, but most just don't show anything at all.

Have you checked to make sure that the graphics card setting in the bios is set to PCI-E, and not onboard, or whatever it's labeled as on this board?  I wouldn't think this would matter with an igpu-less CPU, but it could, maybe.



It is possible that you have a defective card.  I would try to test this card in an otherwise known-good system.  If it works there, the problem is some part of your motherboard/graphics card arrangement.  if it doesn't work in your known-good system, then suspect the graphics card."

Plan A

is get PC to local computer shop asap and transfer most of the hardware that will work in new case over to a new more airflow capable Case,   They sell Thermaltake Gaming cases starting at $69.00,  Labor about $100 i guess isn't too bad,  at least then i know it'll be done right and system will work fine hopefully and cool better



Plan B

Find a software solution, and save the money for a future new motherboard, intel processor, and ram, and get new case then.

Technically it is safe to run at that temperate, at worse your GPU will start thermal throttling to downclock to something more manageable. May I ask why you don't choose to transfer the component yourself?"

Yes!  The component in question is a Sinopower SM7320 dual N-type mosfet package.  Two MOSFETs in one package.



In this case, our isopropanol short detection method worked really well; it doesn't always give us such clear results.  In person, there was actually an audible pop and a visible puff of vapor that came off of that.  And yes, I know there's a risk of fire when using isopropanol for that.  We do what we have to.



So, now we know that we need to remove that SM7320.  Off it comes.

Next, let's check and see if we've cleared our short.

Yep!  That looks good.  Let's check our removed MOSFET.  Here, the red probe is on the +12V input from the power connector.  The black probe is the output pad, which connects first to the GPU through the choke.  This is definitely in short.

			I don't think you understand the fine wine concept (as in cards get better as they age with driver improvements, not worse).  I'm not even claiming that's happening.  I don't think they optimize drivers for new games on older cards.



Here's a reputable site review at the time of the 2080 launch compared to the 1080Ti.  A whole whopping 1% faster at 1440p AND 4K.



View attachment 255860



Here's a more recent review (2060 super) showing that the 1080Ti is now 11% behind the 2080 and even behind the 2070 Super:

In Nvidias defense they've released multiple architectures in the time span that AMD has stagnated and kept polishing same GCN turd. Most people don't stay at the same company for a long time and I doubt there's a whole lot of institutional knowledge still around to tweak older architectures. Its unlikely malice and more likely just lack of competence."

I don't game much these days and mainly use my computer for photo/video work and have always had dual monitors. My old GTX 660 needs replacing and I see that no new video cards use dual-DVI output connectors anymore. For a new card, I assume I would need to connect monitor 1 to the DVI connector, and monitor 2 to a DisplayPort connector, right?   My question here is, will using different ports for each monitor affect the color calibration I have with software and/or the monitors?   I don't know much about DisplayPort but it was my understanding that it's backward compatible with DVI, however I am not positive.

			Here's a casual observation.  At launch, the 1080Ti was essentially equal to the 2080 which was disappointing at best (I cancelled my 2080 pre-order when I saw reviews).  Now, a 1080Ti can barely keep up with a 2070.  Why is that?  Nvidia wants you to buy a 2070 instead of a used 1080Ti and isn't putting in the effort to optimize for Pascal cards.

			So, after getting my butt kicked by Solan's MSI card all day last sunday, I pulled this card out and had another look at it.  We've got a couple of suspiciously low resistance readings on a couple of its rails, and I'm struggling to figure out if they're just quirks of this card (the Kingpin version has similarly low resistance on those rails by design) or if they're indicative of a short.



I know it's a long shot, but would anyone happen to have a working one of these 980 Ti Classified cards?  If so, would you be willing to take some measurements on it for me?



Specifically, I need to know what the resistance on a functional card is from the memory rail and the 3.3V rail.  Both can be measured without disassembling the card at the Probe-it connector.

I don't know, if it helps, but I have two  ""Gigabyte GTX 980 Ti G1 Gaming"" with different memory chips, and i measured both of them. One comes with Hynix memory, and has 62 ohms on the memory rail, the other one with Samsung chips, has only 15 ohms on the memory rail. So, i think, 10 ohms could be possible."

To make a short story shorter, my girlfriend's brother passed away recently, so I acquired his setup.

This consists of an 8th gen i7, 32gb ddr4, gtx 1080ti sc, and an Elgato HD60 Pro capture card.



I'll admit I had no idea what the elgato was when I first spotted it, and until recently I knew literally nothing about streaming, and streaming setups.



Mind you, the capture card is installed in the same ""gaming PC"". I did some research and noticed that it's common for streamers to have their gaming pc, and then a secondary ""streaming PC"". Is this necessary?



I have another PC that's currently my linux server that I could potentially re-purpose to be used as a streaming PC with the elgato installed.



I did play around with it, and I found it somewhat confusing. Obviously it's got an input and an output port... so I connected the output from my GPU, to the input on the capture, then the output on the capture card to my monitor.

Is this not a common setup? It seemed to work ok like that...



Would I benefit from setting up a secondary PC with the elgato installed?

What are the pro's and cons of running the capture card from a secondary pc, vs. installed directly in the gaming rig?



As you may notice I'm pretty much a noob when it comes to the practice of streaming, but it seems like it might be a fun hobby and I like to tinker, so I'm wondering what's the proper way to go about setting this up?



Thank you all for any input!"

Intel 3570k

 P8Z77-V LK motherboad

16GB 



Up until now two 24"" monitors 1080p have been fine, but my goal is to get a new  27"" monitor greater than 1080P.



I won't be gaming, just need to support for Lightroom and a occasional Photoshop.



The new monitor that I'm considering is 2K WQHD (2560x1440p)



From my motherboard specs - 

Integrated Graphics Processor

Multi-VGA output support : HDMI/DVI/RGB/DisplayPort ports

- Supports HDMI with max. resolution 1920 x 1200 @ 60 Hz

- Supports DVI with max. resolution 1920 x 1200 @ 60 Hz

- Supports RGB with max. resolution 2048 x 1536 @ 75 Hz

- Supports DisplayPort with max. resolution 2560 x 1600 @ 60 Hz

Maximum shared memory of 1696 MB

Supports Intel® HD Graphics 





If I use displayport will this drive the 1440P monitor and a second monitor (DVI or VGA) at 1080p (24"") adequately?



Any help appreciated! If I add a new GPU I may need to upgrade the PSU and due to my computer case, I'll have to remove the motherboard which I wish to avoid! 



If there's a GPU that is energy efficient, that will do a better job than the on board graphics I'm open to that as well.

The card wasn't actually supposed to run the fan at 100% in 2D mode. Idle temp was in the 40s (yes the GPU has a temp reader, perhaps one of the first) . Hardly at critical levels. Normally the fan runs at 50% on the desktop, and the numerous times I've gotten the card to boot up since, it was running at the correct speed. I briefly lowered the speed to 34%, and the artifacts started immediately after. I think that's more coincidence though.



Yes I've gotten this card to work many times since this video went up. Each time it does the exact same thing: It lasts about 5-7 minutes, then artifacts, then a black screen.



Anyway I probably shouldn't have titled the video the way I did, but I thought in the off chance it actually was my fault, others might get a kick out of it."

As far as backup cards simple answer if you aren't lazy, Amazon has 30 day returns, buy a card directly from Amazon use it for 20 something days take the 2 minutes to start a return then drop it off at your local Amazon return spot.

We're not.  It's likely the 2080 ti will still be a great card for a while and I'd say chances are people who could afford them already have enough disposable income to buy the 3080 ti.

Bios appears not to be recognizing video card, Asrock has some extra CSM options which maybe conflicting with the video card firmware (just a guest) which you might try.

This might be worth a try:


Put in the working old video card and go into the bios
Select the Boot Option tab/screen
CSM enabled
""Launch Video OpROM Policy"" option -> change this to UEFI if it was selected to Legacy
There are three options, one you already tried whatever it was, I think that would be Legacy, anyways UEFI should allow the bios to work with the firmware on the 5600XT
Legacy
UEFI
Do Not Launch



Remove the old video card and put in the new and try to see if the motherboard recognizes and can post into the bios with video output.
Disabling CSM from enabled to disabled may work but the manual for some reason says not to.



Test out the card in another computer if you can."

It sounded like he (or she?  I'm not sure) wanted to remain anonymous, so I won't tag him here, but I hope you'll all join me in thanking him for sending it to me.  I'm sure he could have sold this on ebay for a few bucks, but instead, he chose to send it to me so we can all learn something.  I know I speak for all of us when I say I'm grateful, but I hope you'll do so as well.  Anyway, because this was so generously donated by an [H] member, I'm working on the thread first, and I'll upload the video to Youtube later.  I suspect most of us here prefer to read, rather than watch, anyway.



The card in question is an EVGA GeForce 980 Ti ""Classified,"" a product of the uniquely famous Ilya 'TiN' Tsemenko and Vince 'Kingpin' Lucido duo at EVGA.  This was one of the best iterations of the 980 Ti that you could get at the time, and as we'll see later, its very well made, with a lot of features aimed at overclockers (arguably the ""real"" hardware enthusiasts) that gamers shouldn't be that eager to pay extra for.  It's similar to the Kingpin edition (""KPE"" as Kingpin likes to call it), and you can see they're closely related if you look at them side by side.  The KPE really goes ham with the overclocking features, whereas they appear to have been a bit more reasonable with this card.  One thing I think is really neat about this card is that even now, when Nvidia has made it extra difficult, EVGA still really leans in to the extreme overclocker crowd, and not only employs TiN and Kingpin for the purpose of making special cards like this, but allows them to be accessible to the community in ways that none of the other board vendors do.  MSI and Galax used to have similar product lines (called ""Lightning"" and ""Hall of Fame"" respectively), but it's really only EVGA that's still obviously putting in this much effort.  Furthermore, TiN, at least, is a shockingly accessible person.  He apparently owns and operates Xdevs.com, where he makes similar content to mine, and will sometimes respond if you reach out to him and ask a question.



Here's the card as it arrived.  It clearly got used, as it's got some dust in the fans, and the heatsink fasteners show some evidence of having been removed at some point, but it doesn't appear to have been abused, or used for GPU mining in an outdoor shed or anything.  Frankly, this is exactly what I would expect this card to look like at this point in its life, having been owned by the sort of person it's intended for.  It even still has the peely-film on it.

Those headers are among the things that make this card special.  The one on the left is what EVGA calls the ""Probe-it"" header, which consists of a series of voltage read points.  With the exception of the 5V rail, every one of the voltage rails on the card is present there.  There is a wiring harness that plugs into this; I'm not sure if it comes with the card, but we don't happen to have it.  For our purposes, we can just probe the pins directly, so that's no biggie.  For competitive overclocking, you'd want that wiring harness.



The other header is a connector for what EVGA calls an ""EVBot,"" which is an external controller gizmo that allows real time control of the card's voltage rails.  EVGA doesn't seem to make them anymore, but it has some advantages over using software that runs on the host system, and it's a cool feature that they include on this card.



A visual inspection of the card reveals a bit of physical damage here, near the PCI-E finger, where we can see we're missing a couple of 0402-size SMD capacitors.  I don't know if this damage happened before or after the card was shipped to me.  It seems likely that it may have happened before, as I've been pretty careful handling it, but I can't rule out the possibility that I did this.  Fortunately, this is a pretty common thing, and should be relatively easy to fix.  It might also help explain why the card doesn't work.  Those little caps actually are critical, as they're in series with the PCI-E data lines.  I've mused about this before, but I wonder if this sort of damage is one of the reasons that those metal shrouds are becoming common on newer cards.  I bet the cost of including that is less than an RMA.

Probably a 120, but if you have an 80 sitting around, try that.



Also try just running the system with the side panel off and see if that fixes the problem. If it does, then you know that you need better ventilation and can look at installing more fans.



Another possibility is that the heatsink grease is dried out, in which case running without the case panel won't make a very big difference."

New cards are pretty expensive right now, and a 10 series card or previous gen RX you have to worry about refurbished cards that previously died or cards that were used for mining.

I would say anyone with a 2080ti is in a hard position. We don't know how much of a boost you guys will get, I just know I will get a significant one and since I'm ready to upgrade to 4k this maybe an easy choice for me. As far as backup cards simple answer if you aren't lazy, Amazon has 30 day returns, buy a card directly from Amazon use it for 20 something days take the 2 minutes to start a return then drop it off at your local Amazon return spot. Khols for me, I did this waiting for my 2080 to get here after returning my 2080ti. I saw this RX580 on offer up for $75 and thought it was worth it."

			1070Ti is still a damned good card for 60hz 1440P.. Handles most of the games I care to play on ultra settings and will hold above 60FPS.. Granted I don't play everything in existence.. most recent was Far Cry 5.. Ultra 1440P frame rates were pretty much averaging in the 70s.



Turn the settings down a tad for competitive games like pubg and you'll fly over 100FPS..

I unfortunately don't have the donor card. It's entirely based off the TPU site.

Yeah, basically, make sure that you have at least one additional functioning video card, and a PC that can accommodate both this card and your backup.  (That is, two PCI-E slots, and whatever power leads are required).



Make sure to back up the old BIOS first, so you can flash it back on there if things go pear shaped.



As for comparing the boards, look for a photo of the donor card and try to read the label on the memory chips.  If they're the same brand as the ones on your board, it should work.  Should."

			Huh.  I hadn't seen that one.  It's interesting that the only thing he had to change was the DrMOS package.  Your card definitely has something else wrong, since it keeps killing them.  I actually replaced it again after I posted about it yesterday, and it killed that one after just a few seconds.



I feel like the problem pretty much has to be related to the bootstrap circuit, but I can't find anything obviously wrong with it.  I gave up on it for a while yesterday afternoon, but I'll look at it again soon.

The KVM setup generally has the screen on for less than 30 minutes/week so the 3090 being a power pig isn't a major concern, and I've discovered that the larger screen size's readability benefits were a lot larger than I'd expected (getting older sucks) at the larger than normal distance it is from where I sit.  But I can still barely notice the artifacting from non 1:1 scaling, and would like to be able to run it at native hardware resolution with 150% OS scaling for cleaner results.

This right here.  Older Intel processors tend to hold their value as well, so you’d probably have to sink more money than you’d actually want to upgrade that i5 to an i7 from that era, only to still have dated performance.  I personally wouldn’t bother.



The i5 is going to be a bottleneck in a lot of games now.  I ran into the same problem with my i5 4670K.  Looked in to upgrading to an i7 4770K or 4790K and was shocked to discover that the processors I could find online had the same sticker price as they had when I built my system in 2013.  Literally no decline in price whatsoever.  You’ll probably be happier if you can hold out for a little longer and do it right the first time.



Also, prices for video cards are currently elevated thanks to increased demand and decreased supply due to COVID-19.  It’s an expensive time to upgrade, so your money won’t stretch as far.

			Moore's Law died in like 2011. From December 2011-April 2016 we were stuck on 28nm, rather than the typical 2 year node cadence previously. So that was basically 5.5 years stuck on 28nm.



Nvidia is finally dropping a node later this year in 3rd QTR 2020, around a 4.5 year cadence. A little quicker than 28nm, but we were basically stuck for close to 5 years. Sure if felt quicker, because they kept renaming the node from 20nm to 16nm to 12 nm, but in reality the transistor size was actually the same so we were effectively on the same node the entire time.

It depends.  When Turing launched at absurd pricing, Pascal actually got a boost in price.  1080Ti's were around $475 prior to the Turing launch.  Afterward, they were pushing $550-575.  I canceled my 2080 preorder and just bought a used 1080Ti, but then sold it for more than I paid for it a few months later."

			This right here.  Older Intel processors tend to hold their value as well, so you’d probably have to sink more money than you’d actually want to upgrade that i5 to an i7 from that era, only to still have dated performance.  I personally wouldn’t bother.



The i5 is going to be a bottleneck in a lot of games now.  I ran into the same problem with my i5 4670K.  Looked in to upgrading to an i7 4770K or 4790K and was shocked to discover that the processors I could find online had the same sticker price as they had when I built my system in 2013.  Literally no decline in price whatsoever.  You’ll probably be happier if you can hold out for a little longer and do it right the first time.



Also, prices for video cards are currently elevated thanks to increased demand and decreased supply due to COVID-19.  It’s an expensive time to upgrade, so your money won’t stretch as far.

Just about anything saved as a backup or spare will lose value upto a point. My card is a cheap one that I would say for me under $200 I can put it on a shelf and let it depreciate. A 2080ti , if I new I was upgrading wouldn't be left as a backup. I think 2080ti owners that know they want to upgrade and sell are in the tightest spot for when to make that sale. Too late and you could lose a larger amount compared to someone with a 2080 or even 2070. The main problem is the higher starting cost and perceived value vs the new stuff."

			I don't think you understand the fine wine concept (as in cards get better as they age with driver improvements, not worse).  I'm not even claiming that's happening.  I don't think they optimize drivers for new games on older cards.



Here's a reputable site review at the time of the 2080 launch compared to the 1080Ti.  A whole whopping 1% faster at 1440p AND 4K.



View attachment 255860



Here's a more recent review (2060 super) showing that the 1080Ti is now 11% behind the 2080 and even behind the 2070 Super:

View attachment 255864



You can claim fail, lies, and fuckery all you want, but show me some actual numbers.
		
		Click to expand...
	
You're reading the chart wrong.



The original 2080 review from TPU shows the 1080 Ti is (92 - 100)/100 = 8% slower.



The 2060 Super review shows the 1080 Ti is (113 - 122)/122 = 7.4% slower.



Think of it in terms of FPS.  If we converted the 100% of the 2060 Super to, say 70 FPS:


1080 Ti = 113% of a 2060 Super = 70 * 1.13 = 79.1 FPS
2080 = 122% of a 2060 Super = 70 * 1.22 = 85.4 FPS
(79.1 - 85.4)/85.4 = -7.4% (-0.0737704918)
You can do the above calculation with literally any base number for the 2060 Super and come up with the same 7.4%, technically meaning the 1080 Ti got faster compared to the 2080 over time at 1440p."

			Oh sorry, I saw crazycrave posted the CX650M, thought that was you saying that got myself confused!  Yeah... that 350w PSU is probably having issues keeping up with the power requirements.



According to AMD

https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/radeon-rx-5700-series-quick-start-guide-en.pdf

"" Minimum 600W (recommended 700W) PSU with up to an 8-pin + 6-pin PCI Express Auxiliary connectors. This PSU recommendation is only for one Radeon RX 5700 series GPU installed per system. Additional GPUs will require more capable power supplies.""



Your 350w is not going to cut it.  That CX650M was probably supposed to be a suggestion from crazycrave.  It's like $95 from Best Buy so you can get local.  Semi modular so you don't have a bunch of unnecessary cables laying around.  You can find cheapers ones too, but it would work well.  That said, the 5700xt does use more power than a 5700 and you could probably get by with 500w (namebrand) PSU but I woudn't chance it.  I would get a decent one that won't give you issues in the future.  If you need help locating a decent one let us know your budget and if you were trying to find something local or are ok with newegg or amazon or new/used, etc.  The game works with your on board because it's not pulling so many watts.

			If your display has a scalar built-in, and you're ok with that, you'll probably stumble into something that lets you play at non-native. If it's native or bust, you better do your research. I'm not sure there are guarantees out there. So be prepared for that.



As for HDMI to DVI Dual Link at QHD 60Hz resolution? Forget it. HDMI doesn't physically support dual link. I've done a ton of research over the years, and such a thing simply doesn't exist. It's like a magical unicorn or something. Most who claim they got it to work at QHD 60Hz are pretty much full of shit. Maybe QHD at a significantly reduced refresh rate. The best you can hope for is single link bandwidth over HDMI, which will not get you to that coveted 2560x1440 @ 60Hz native resolution. Converting HDMI to DVI Dual Link would require all sorts of processing, and most likely add delay, so even if such a thing existed, it wouldn't be cheap nor ideal for gaming.



DisplayPort is another matter. DisplayPort can physically support dual link channels. I've seen enough convincing success stories of Active DisplayPort to DVI Dual Link pulling off 2560x1440@60Hz, that I know it's a thing. But from what I can gather, and it's been a year since I last looked into this, it's going to be a YMMV scenario. It's going to depend on how nice everything plays together.



Between HDMI and DP, an Active DisplayPort to DVI Dual Link adapter is your best bet.

There were a handful of monitors that could take an HDMI 1.3/1.4 signal over a single DVI link (essentially a 100% overclock).  Anyone with one of them actually can use a cheap HDMI/DVI to 1440/1600p 60hz adapter (and there're a number of people selling this sort of adapter without clearly indicating that for most monitors it won't work); but only a handful of displays from the very tail end of DVI only for cheap 1440p ever supported this.  In particular, affaik no 'good' 1440/1600p DVI only monitors did; because they either predated the faster HDMI standard or supported it correctly with a native 1.3/1.4 HDMI port (and probably an equivalent DP port).



If you can try and return for free, there's no harm in trying active DP-DVI adapters but they've all got enough reported issues that I suspect you'll end up having to buy a new monitor anyway."

The problem is, what do you do if you don't have a backup GPU? I have a 2080 Ti right now but I don't even know what to buy as a backup card? New cards are pretty expensive right now, and a 10 series card or previous gen RX you have to worry about refurbished cards that previously died or cards that were used for mining. Plus if you even think about it, you are basically paying launch prices for 2016 cards. You've got 1070 Tis going for like $350 on ebay. It's so depressing right now lol."

Right,



Intel half-assed their DP 1.1 implementation, which is why it only supports half the maximum bandwidth on-releases.  But that's still more than enough to handle 1600p.





The later introduced full 4k support, but I'm not sure just how fast it is (not clear if adding the second port gets you 4k@30, or 4k at 60?)



https://www.anandtech.com/show/6270/ivy-bridge-gets-4k-display-support-in-october



Since you have HD 4000, it should be more than enough for 1440p + 1080p desktop work / casual games @1080p.  Just make sure you have dual-channel ram working correctly at at least DDR3 1600"

			Moore's Law died in like 2011. From December 2011-April 2016 we were stuck on 28nm, rather than the typical 2 year node cadence previously. So that was basically 5.5 years stuck on 28nm.



Nvidia is finally dropping a node later this year in 3rd QTR 2020, around a 4.5 year cadence. A little quicker than 28nm, but we were basically stuck for close to 5 years. Sure if felt quicker, because they kept renaming the node from 20nm to 16nm to 12 nm, but in reality the transistor size was actually the same so we were effectively on the same node the entire time.

			MY guess is any 75W half height card would work, unless it would refuse to fall back on PCE2.0 for some reason.  The PSU is small enough I'm assuming you don't have a 6pin connector to run anything more powerful even if you could find one that would fit.



EDIT.  apparently the SFF version is limited to 50W on the PCIe slot (page 16).  If that's a hard limit you might be stuck with something like a 1030, because anyhing bigger will want 75W.

Make sure to back up the old BIOS first, so you can flash it back on there if things go pear shaped.

Yes, thanks, that would be super helpful!



Here's what you do:



Grab a multimeter and set it to resistance (Ohms) mode.  That's the omega symbol.  Most default to auto ranging, which is fine.

		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""ohmsmode.jpg""
		title=""ohmsmode.jpg"" />





Our first measurement is the memory power rail.  This can be measured in many places, but with the card assembled, the easiest place on this card is likely the probe-it connector.  I've marked the pin you want in this photo.  With the card face down on the table, it's the third pin from the left.

		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""probeit_vmem.jpg""
		title=""probeit_vmem.jpg"" />





To take a measurement, put the red probe on the pin or solder pads, and the black probe on something that's connected to ground, the metal casing around the dvi connector.  With handheld meters, the reading will swim a bit.  That's OK.  I believe the expected value should be around 15 ohms.  Whatever you get, post it here.



Our next measurement is resistance through the 3.3V rail.  For this, the best place to measure is the PCI-E connector.  Put your red probe on any of the pads I've marked here, and the black probe on any ground, such as the outside of the DVI connector.  On most cards, you'd expect to see between 200 and 1000 ohms.  Whatever reading you get, post it here.

That suggests some sort of logic issue.  In my own testing, it doesn't work at all, perhaps as a result of the damage to the PCI-E interface.  I suspect there's more going on, but we'll see.



Our first diagnostic step is to check resistance to ground on each of the board's voltage rails.



Here's the first 12V rail.  That's 55Mohms, which is unusually high.  We'll need to remember this and investigate later.  It's not a short to ground, though, so we're not going to risk a fire if we plug this thing in and power it up.

		class=""bbImage ""

		title=""12V_2.jpg"" />





Availing myself of the handy-dandy Probe-it header, we'll check the other rails.  I also sanity checked these against the actual logic, but I really love the Probe-it header, so that's what I'm showing here.  I wish every card had this.



VCore looks good.  Remember that we're looking for single digits here.

		title=""res_vcore.jpg"" />





Memory... looks wacky.  Oddly, if you look at the docs for the EVGA EPower V, they claim that the resistance on this rail is actually supposed to be 15 ohms, which is also quite low, so it's possible that this is within spec, but I expect this is probably related to whatever the original problem was.  On a ""normal"" 980 Ti, like the MSI Golden Edition we looked at before, this would be more like 75 ohms.

Vpll looks OK as far as I can tell.

3.3V looks...  Kinda low.  This could be normal, though.

The last one is the 12V rails again.  I gather this is wired up to the far 8 pin connector, as it shows a normal-ish resistance, and not the millions we saw on the near one.

There's basically no difference between RGB 4:4:4 and YCbCr 4:4:4 IF the latter option supports full range. When it doesn't, you're limited to a color ramp of 16-235 vs 0-255. But, you'll always want to use RGB on computer monitors because it's been the standard since forever. TVs on the other hand have had a range of different color spaces due to the different formats they have to support, and may not support true RGB.



YCbCr 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 shouldn't be used unless that's the only thing the display supports. If you have to use these modes, it's probably a good time to look for a new display."

https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-core-x



The razer core x will work on pretty much any thunderbolt 3 egpu supporting laptop. The Alienware only works on Alienware and I believe uses a proprietary dell connector only on the supporting Alienware laptops.



The Alienware combo is cheaper, even more so if you get typical Dell discounts of 15%-20%, however, it is more limiting given being locked down to Alienware and it doesn't support quite as large GPU's.



The Razer one is better all around though. Far better support and works with both PC & Mac, and supports larger GPU's. That being said, i'd likely buy a Razer laptop anyways just to ensure you never have issues with drivers/software support that almost always exist with things like this.



There are other options on the market, but I wouldn't recommend them given that they are kind of doing their own thing and you can't be sure you'll have rock solid support.

The 2600k is just as old as your 2500k so it would be a drop in replacement but frankly even that struggles in some modern titles now. (and you really need to overclock the 2500k or 2600k to see keep up with more recent CPUs)



You really need to replace mobo, cpu, ram, and gpu at this point if you want to play AAA titles at higher settings. You could purchase a decent GPU like a 1660 super in your budget and move it over to your new build when you save another ~$300. With an overclock on your 2500k it could still perform pretty decent in titles that dont need more than 4 cores.



This probably isn't as cost effective as limping along and buying everything at once ( at which point there will likely be cheaper \ faster options available) but it does let you get some instant gratification."

I'm having some issues running an older GTX 780 reference model (the one with the metal heatblower) with a B350+2600X combo.



The 780 is fine, and so is the 2600X/B350. The 780 won't post while the PCIE slot is set to Gen1/2 (documented issue) with Zen+ 2xxx CPUs.

https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/ryzen-7-2700x-no-display-on-boot.421204/

https://community.amd.com/thread/228819



AMD basically says run the GPU in PCIE1.0 to get it to work. This is fine and all, if this was the end of it, since PCIE 1.0 probably won't starve the GTX 780 anyway. My problem is that the computer will now boot but gaming of any sort will result in a black screen after a few minutes in. Chipset and GPU drivers are updated, and I can confirm the GPU was still working since it was last in my Haswell rig.



Upon further reading, it seems all 780s with 80.10.xx VBIOS have this compatibility problem. Palit seems to have never released an updated VBIOS, if techpowerup is any indication. HOWEVER, other manufacturers have, and it seems to be fixed with the GTX 780 VBIOS versions that start with the 80.80.xx



Is it possible to flash the VBIOS with an updated one from a different manufacturer?

Looking at this EVGA one, which seems to be a reference model.

GTX 780; used  to be a GT 1030

Corsair RMX 550



I'd rather not spend cash out on a new card since this is my GTX 780 I'm basically gifting to a relative.



Thanks!"

Yeah... that 350w PSU is probably having issues keeping up with the power requirements.



According to AMD

https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/radeon-rx-5700-series-quick-start-guide-en.pdf

"" Minimum 600W (recommended 700W) PSU with up to an 8-pin + 6-pin PCI Express Auxiliary connectors. This PSU recommendation is only for one Radeon RX 5700 series GPU installed per system. Additional GPUs will require more capable power supplies.""



Your 350w is not going to cut it.  That CX650M was probably supposed to be a suggestion from crazycrave.  It's like $95 from Best Buy so you can get local.  Semi modular so you don't have a bunch of unnecessary cables laying around.  You can find cheapers ones too, but it would work well.  That said, the 5700xt does use more power than a 5700 and you could probably get by with 500w (namebrand) PSU but I woudn't chance it.  I would get a decent one that won't give you issues in the future.  If you need help locating a decent one let us know your budget and if you were trying to find something local or are ok with newegg or amazon or new/used, etc.  The game works with your on board because it's not pulling so many watts."

That budget was $300 and a laptop if possible. After I looked at the recommended spec, I told them that it is quite a stretch since the recommendation is using Quadro or Radeon Pro GPUs and it'd be closer to $1000.  Even using GTX/RTX is a stretch for a decent setup and isn't recommended.



Upgrade budget - $500 or less if possible.

Build/Laptop budget- < $1000 a must



Primary use -

- Run Solidworks for school/training for about a year. If it's a laptop, it would just be used for casual interwebs and use.

Secondary use -

- Plex transcoder - I have had up to 5 streams at a time with at least 3 of them transcoding- I'd like to be able to support 5-8 transcodes.

- I currently have Plex running in a Windows VM on the DL380 G6s (2x in a VMWare cluster).



Using VMware and a Windows VM:

- I may be able to get a single slot GPU to run in if it doesn't require additional power.  I can also upgrade to X5670s to get the 3.0Ghz minimum.

Or

- I have a have a S5500bc but is limited to x8 pci-e slots and would require a x16 to x8 ribbon but would at least alow for additional power and not have space constraints.  I can also upgrade to the same X5670s. It's limited to 32GB max but would work for Solidworks and/or Plex.

Or

I pricier upgrade. I have a Tyan S8812 (G34) I could upgrade to 6380 or 6386 SE (maybe) and this board does have an x16 pci-e.



Is anybody running this today and have any real-world tests done?  I was looking at creating a few accounts (if needed) to test out different machines but didn't really want to spend that much time

AMD is not competitive at the high end. Nvidia has no need to innovate since nobody can touch them. Prices are going up due to lac of competition.

Over the years, the one issue I have seen with displayport connectors, is that the average person doesn't know about them and assumes it is an HDMI connector. 

Seen damaged displayport cables/ports because people don't realize that (some) DP cables have a lock on them, and use brute force to disconnect.  Seems that a lot of the cheapie OEM cables have dropped the locking mechanism."

That card is bus powered and has both DVI and DisplayPort.  It should do exactly what you need.



There are cheaper options, such as the 1050 that would also do what you need, but they may be harder to find at this point.  Used RX580s are also abundant and pretty cheap, but they generally require more power, and may necessitate a power supply upgrade.

Here's a casual observation.  At launch, the 1080Ti was essentially equal to the 2080 which was disappointing at best (I cancelled my 2080 pre-order when I saw reviews).  Now, a 1080Ti can barely keep up with a 2070.  Why is that?  Nvidia wants you to buy a 2070 instead of a used 1080Ti and isn't putting in the effort to optimize for Pascal cards."

			There is no way you only top out at 60c if it's under full load and overclocked. Even at the out of the box clocks 60c would be impossible unless you have a VERY aggressive fan profile that you are using. Heck even their Gaming X cards don't even run that low on temperatures.



Edit: Yep 67c under full gaming load even with the 3 fan Gaming X. https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-2070-super-gaming-x-trio/31.html

          Well that is their results, not mine. I see and report what I see. Now, as I did this when it was a bit cooler in my place w/o AC on (live a mile up in mountains @ above 5k ft), I waited until I got a nice hot day and made sure the window was closed with no fan circulating the air. It got up to 72. However, this is OCed to 1113 mem and 112 gpu. The fan curve is slightly aggressive as all should know that factory fan curves are crap for any vid card. It is not constant 90% or anything, but does have a low in the 35% range and every 10 degrees it gets up there and seems to max at about 85%. I use the Kumbustor Physx for GPU which pushes it to 99% (100 effectively) and that is when I got my 72c. Even with all that being pushed, I could barely hear the fans as my Vardars at half rpm (EKWB Custom CPU loop) seem to drown it out (yeah they can be loud!) I have my gaming rig housed in a Coolermaster HAF 932 Advanced, which, if you google pics of that, is a huge case with tons of airflow. So, lesson here to learn is that what you may perceive as improbable or impossible might not be the case (no pun intended) I must say, though, given how well the loop does for my CPU, I am thinking of trying to get one setup for my GPU and see if I can OC further!

The razer core x will work on pretty much any thunderbolt 3 egpu supporting laptop. The Alienware only works on Alienware and I believe uses a proprietary dell connector only on the supporting Alienware laptops.



The Alienware combo is cheaper, even more so if you get typical Dell discounts of 15%-20%, however, it is more limiting given being locked down to Alienware and it doesn't support quite as large GPU's.



The Razer one is better all around though. Far better support and works with both PC & Mac, and supports larger GPU's. That being said, i'd likely buy a Razer laptop anyways just to ensure you never have issues with drivers/software support that almost always exist with things like this.



There are other options on the market, but I wouldn't recommend them given that they are kind of doing their own thing and you can't be sure you'll have rock solid support."

With great difficulty, I was able to get the tiny MOSFET soldered back on the card.  The silver you see next to it is solder used to tin the upper side of the traces.  Being thin copper, it seemed prudent to reinforce them a bit in case this carries more current than I think it does.  I debated whether to epoxy coat it, but I think I'll leave it bare for now, at least until I've had a chance to really test the card with a game.  



I cleaned off most of the flux residue and tested the card briefly, and it still seems to work, so our next step will be to reassemble the cooler.  This is unfortunately, one of the more time consuming parts of the process, because I have to move the camera around a bunch for the sake of the video.  Stay tuned..."

It's an el-cheepo Norco box that I changed-out with much quieter fans and an AIO liquid cooling loop, so it barely puts out any dBs.



Assuming I have a free adequate PCI-E slot (the machine already has two Supermicro cards), I'll just do the 1050, as I really am curious to see what HDR content looks like.  No gaming or productivity will happen on this TV, just brainless vidiot watching.



I actually have no idea what sort of embedded streaming solution comes with the TV.  All I know at this point is that it's running some form of Android, as I came across an optimization screen that's almost identical to my phone (an S7).  It does have an Ethernet port, though.  It would be neat to send video files to the TV via it from the HTPC and let the TV itself handle all the decoding and playback, but my lack of brain cells probably precludes such a cool solution.  I also have no earthly idea how I'd interface with the TV since all it came with was a tiny remote that only has around 10 buttons (unlike the DLP remote which had around 50)."

The pins farther away from the latch are the 12V input.  You should have 3 pins that supply 12V and five that have continuity to ground.  Pin 1 is the one with a square shaped shroud in the row farther from the latch.

My wife has a little itx haswell i5 that was running the integrated GPU with HDMI out.  This PC had been running fine for roughly 5 or so years.  A few months ago her video stopped working on the PC.  Here are the steps I took to bring me to this WTF is going on post.



Steps to troubleshoot:


Plugged her laptop into the monitor, no issues, got video.
Installed an older PCIE video card into her MB, no video.
Tried a different PSU, no video.
Tried different RAM, no video.
Tried an i7, no video.
At this point I have concluded, oh well, the itx MB is shot.  I decided to put all the parts back together that I used to test her ITX out, and just say F it.  She would now have a normal tower at her desk.  I proceeded like a good husband, and rebuilt my old PC, installed everything as we all would.  I reused her SSD without reinstalling the os as going from an i5 to an i7 with the same generation haswell parts should not cause a windows issue.  I also used the older video card as it was better than the iGPU haswell.  I plug everything in, let windows update, restarted multiple times, tested both the GPU and iGPU with no issue.  Now, I unplug everything to tidy it up where the case should go.  I had all the peripherals connected and the monitor connected and powered to the power strip.  I plugged the PC into the power strip and had a large pop at the power strip.  Uh oh, no video again!  Now, keep in mind, this time I was using a video card, not the internal.  Of course, the large pop is associated with a charred electrical plug and the good ole electrical burning smell.  



WTF?  Now I have fried a GPU, so I decide to test the iGPU, and it is fried too! 



Has anyone ever seen this before?  This is not my first rodeo in building PCs.  Been doing this for over 20 yrs.  Can a monitor be faulty and fry video cards and iGPUs through HDMI?  I am oh so very confused.  I do know that everything is going in the garbage, that's for sure.

I've got another card on the bench today, and that's this MSI 980 Ti Golden Edition.  This card came to me as part of a lot of dead graphics cards, and it's the least promising among the bunch, so we're looking at it first.



I made a video for those who prefer such things.  As an aside, if the mods don't approve of spamming my own videos here, I hope they'll reach out and warn me before I get banned.  I couldn't find a list who the actual video card forum mods are.  There use to be one, back in the before time...


	
		
	


Anyway, on to the card.  This card is mainly interesting because it comes with this really neat all copper heatsink, which is sort of unusual.  From the outside, the card looks pretty clean, and there's no obvious damage visible to explain why it doesn't work.  I always liked this generation of MSI's cards - I think they're nice looking.  In case it doesn't come across in the photo, the shroud protecting the fans is also copper colored, unlike the red shroud you get on the regular versions.





What the seller told me is that the system doesn't even power up with this card plugged in.  That is a sure sign that we have a short through our 12V power plane.  Before we attempt to test the card, we should check on this, as the potential exists to damage the card or some other part of the test system if it's the case.



We can do this without disassembling the card by testing the pins at the connector.  I really prefer to use the solder joints, but this card has this handsome backplate that's in the way.

Resistance on the far connector...  The 290X from our last thread is on the bench here to remind me which pins are ground and which are not.

It's interesting that it's pretty dead on 750 ohms.  That's unusually low for a 12V rail, but I wonder if there's some sort of current monitoring shenanigans going on that requires it.  Nvidia loves to prescribe that kind of thing, whereas AMD seems to like to just over-build the card and let it run really hot if it needs to.



Resistance on the near connector.  As I suspected, basically a dead short.

We can't reach any of the solder joints to diagnose what failed with the heatsink on, so we'll need to remove it.

With the card disassembled, it's pretty obvious that we've got some serious damage going on.

Here's a  couple of close-ups of it.  The PCB got so hot in this area that it burned the coating off, and also melted the solder holding that dual MOSFET package on.  See how the pins are bridged?

What we're seeing here is a textbook example of the high-side MOSFET failing and shunting 12V into somewhere it doesn't belong.  I bet this smelled amazing.



The component that looks the most suspicious is a SinoPower SM7320 dual N-type MOSFET package.  This isn't really a power stage, but rather just a high side and low side MOSFET together in one little package.  We're clearly going to need to remove it, but let's take some resistance measurements first.



The Vcore rail.  This isn't out of the question as a sane resistance for GPU this size, but it is a little bit low.





<img src=""https://hardforum.com/data/attachment-files/2020/02/thumb/325218_vcore.jpg""
		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""vcore.jpg""
		title=""vcore.jpg"" />



The memory rail.  Looks... Sane, at least.

Edit:  Shoot, I lost the image from this one.  It's about 65 ohms.  



Probably 3.3V from the slot connector.  Important thing is we don't have a short.

Edit:  You'll have to take my word for it that this was 365 ohms on the nose.  Voltage monitoring of some sort?



This card doesn't have the great big memory controller rail like AMD cards of similar vintage do, so that's pretty much all the measuring we need to do for now.  Our memory rail looks like it's probably undamaged, and given that the failed MOSFET appears to be part of the Vcore VRM (that is, the biggest one), it's probably a safe assumption that our damage is limited to that. As bad as the damage to the PCB looks, it is possible that the only actual short is inside that MOSFET package.   Let's get the burned components off the board now, and see what happens with our short.  Hot air station, go!!

		alt=""hot air 2.jpg""
		title=""hot air 2.jpg"" />





After letting the board cool down a bit, we'll check our 12V resistance again.  Presumably,  we want to see something like 750 ohms, if they're doing the same current monitoring on this rail as they did on the other.

		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""short_2.jpg""
		title=""short_2.jpg"" />





Unfortunately, our short is even worse now.  With the MOSFET removed from the board, the next most likely suspect is the damaged PCB itself.  I did some picking to see if it's just the outer layers touching, and ended up with this...





<img src=""https://hardforum.com/data/attachment-files/2020/02/thumb/325213_after_sanding.jpg""
		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""after_sanding.jpg""
		title=""after_sanding.jpg"" />





I also checked resistance on our removed SM7320.  What we're looking at here is the resistance between the pad that gets 12V and the one that supplies the output to the GPU.  With no voltage to the gate, we should several million ohms here, but we see instead is zero.  This means we had 12V sent directly to the GPU circuit for some length of time, and if we assume the user tried to start the system back up, probably more than once.  It also implies that the damage to the PCB probably happened later, as a result of this, and not the other way around.

		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""deadmosfet.jpg""
		title=""deadmosfet.jpg"" />





At length, I was able to get the resistance through the board up to about 30 ohms.  I suspect that if I got more aggressive, and Dremeled the top couple of layers in the damaged area, I could clear the short, but I'm doubtful that would be productive, given the likelihood of the core having taken 12V on the chin several times.

At this point, I think it's safe to conclude this card is beyond saving.  That said, I've got a pretty awesome heatsink for it now, so I may revisit this card later if I can find a less totally destroyed card to use that heatsink, or any of its other parts on.  I'm open to offers if anyone happens to have a dead MSI 980 Ti lying around. 



I talked in the video about how I suspect this card died as a result of hamfisted overclocking coupled with, potentially, a weak power supply.  This is basically the same mode of failure (at a grander scale) that we saw on the 690s last year, and I think a quirk of this card's design, where the gates appear to be driven with 12V, instead of 7V from another regulator, exacerbates the potential for the same thing to happen here.  So, IMHO, if we've learned anything, it's that one should keep an eye on the health of one's power supply, as in some cases, relying on it to be healthy is the only thing keeping this from happening."

Thanks, I was using that and trying to cross-reference with the Solidworks page.  Running 3 would likely be fine, unlimited would just be the icing on the cake. On CL, someone was selling a Grid K2 for a good price but it's not on that list and not a lot of info for plex since it's primarily for VDI. I don't need external video, so that isn't an issue. I did also see someone selling a 1060 (3G) for $75, I think, which would be good as well (3 transcode limit).



The biggest gain I think I'll get is to upgrade my CPUs to something that supports quick sync since they are older 5series Xeons... and Xeons in general without IGP. Maybe the cpu paired with something like the 1060, would be a solid plex machine, no?  I currently battle transcodes with cores (10vcpu assigned to plex VM).

			We did tests at work and unless you are doing shaded renderings, the CPU handles pretty much everything in Solidworks.



Going with a really nice GPU and an older CPU is going to really be pointless for Solidworks.



Really need to know how complicated and large the drawings are and what type of real-time rendering they want to do before any real recommendation can be made.



If you really want to get a nice Quadro or Radeon Pro card, get a used recent model on eBay for way, way less than they go for new.



Here is a Dell Precision 7720 with a Quadro P3000 for $1,000 + shipping on ebay:

Thanks for the help. Got more details over the weekend. Looks like a mid-level laptop ($500-$600) should be plenty for their daily needs, the price can still get a decently fast CPU with IGP.  The Solidworks training will be completed through a VM during class and they will not have to install it on their local machine.  This obviously makes shopping for a laptop much easier and leaves me with only the plex requirement."

The really frustrating thing is that, if I just remove the dead MOSFET, it should work fine.  I wouldn't recommend overclocking, but it does run.  Can't really call that repaired, though.



Something I've noticed is that the bootstrap circuits, which act as a sort of power supply for the high side MOSFETs seem to be pretty weak on this card.  There's supposed to be a capacitor that charges up, and the energy it stores is used to help turn the high side transistor on.  The datasheet for the phase controllers calls for a 270nf cap, but the only ones I can find on here are 100nf."

I then tested the card again, but we still get no post.  I think this pretty much confirms that the real reason it doesn't work is related to our low memory voltage.

Unfortunately, a voltage rail that runs but is just low is one of the hardest problems to diagnose that we might encounter, at least in this case because we don't have a datasheet for the controller.  We could, with great difficulty, figure out what on it is connected to what, but without the datasheet, there's almost no way we'd be able to troubleshoot it.

I'll have to give some thought to what to do next.  We're kind of stuck without datasheets for anything."

I'd have to have the card in my hands to say for sure, but I suspect that's probably still salvageable, assuming there isn't any other damage.  I don't offer graphics card repairs as a service for hire, mainly for the reason that it isn't really practical to do as a business, but also because I fail more often than I succeed, as was the case with the card in this thread.  That said, I once offered to look at a card for another [H] member for free, with the understanding that the possibility exists I may it worse, and that I'd make some content for the forum and Youtube.



If you're OK with those terms, I could probably offer the same deal to you.  That would be a pretty good way for this thread to conclude, now that I think about it.

No offense taken. I had only started after being unable to find a place to send it in for repair (having asked manufacturers first then third parties).



It was with a butane soldering iron that I had used before for some thru-hole capacitor replacements on motherboards but it was definitely not right for working a small SMD.

Based on Solan's initial description, I knew that we have a short to ground on one of our card's 12V inputs.  We know this because he told us that it doesn't allow the system to power up with a cable connected to one of them.  What that means is the system actually is powering up for just a moment, seeing massive current draw through the board, and then shutting down to avoid damaging the power supply or causing a fire.

We can test this with some simple resistance measurements.  



First, the far 12V power connector.  A few K is what we're looking for here, so this looks good.





<img src=""https://hardforum.com/data/attachment-files/2020/06/thumb/355808_12v_far.jpg""
		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""12v_far.jpg""
		title=""12v_far.jpg"" />





Next, the near power connector.  2.6 ohms is basically a dead short.

		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""12V_near.jpg""
		title=""12V_near.jpg"" />





It turns out that the area that Solan's pictures show, which is visibly damaged, is connected to our shorted power rail directly.  There are two MOSFETs in that area.  One is connected to the 8 pin power connector as shown here.  The other, as it turns out, is connected to the PCI-E slot connector.





<img src=""https://hardforum.com/data/attachment-files/2020/06/thumb/355811_wiredupdirectly.jpg""
		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""wiredupdirectly.jpg""
		title=""wiredupdirectly.jpg"" />





At first, I thought maybe the remaining mosfet that Solan did not remove could be shorted, but some probing around the board indicated that neither side of this power balancing circuit is connected to ground.  So, I removed the heatsink to get a look at the front of the board, expecting to see something similar to our poor Golden Edition.



Lo and behold, though, the front of the board looks ok.  There's nothing visible here to indicate where our problem is.





<img src=""https://hardforum.com/data/attachment-files/2020/06/thumb/355812_heatsink_off.jpg""
		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""heatsink_off.jpg""
		title=""heatsink_off.jpg"" />





So, I cleaned up the area as best I could.  A bit of flux and solder wick allowed me to see what's going on with that mutilated pad.  That's the remains of the original mosfet there, somehow permanently fused to the underside of the pad, which has gotten so hot that it's lifted off the board.  We can also see that the gate pin pad has mercifully survived, but the source pin pads have gotten ripped off the board.





<img src=""https://hardforum.com/data/attachment-files/2020/06/thumb/355828_pad_cleanup.jpg""
		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""pad_cleanup.jpg""
		title=""pad_cleanup.jpg"" />





I also removed the other MOSFET, just in case it's somehow actually the cause of the problem.

		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""mosfet_removed.jpg""
		title=""mosfet_removed.jpg"" />





But it's not. The board is still hot in this photo, hence the even lower resistance.

		class=""bbImage ""
		style=""""
		alt=""still_shorted.jpg""
		title=""still_shorted.jpg"" />





At this point, we have to resort to somewhat less gentle techniques in order to locate our short.  This involves installing a surrogate power supply onto the board and supplying current in sufficient quantity to make whatever is shorted get hot enough to detect.  Professionals would normally use a thermal camera for this, but being an amateur, I don't have one.  Instead, we'll use isopropanol, which is cheap, readily available, and arguably better anyway.

Here, I've soldered the leads from my bench power supply onto our affected power connector.

		title=""ps_hookedup.jpg"" />





For better or for worse, I dialed the power supply up to the full 12V that the card should get on this rail.  In retrospect, I should have at least tried 1V first.  Anyway, we got nothing when looking at the back of the card, despite all the visible damage.

We're actually passing about 70 watts through the board in this shot.  See the puddle of isopropanol under the red wire?

Dell XPS 8900

Core i7-6700 @ 4GHz

32gb DDR4 RAM

Intel HD Graphics 530 (integrated)

AMD Radeon RX 480 8gb

256gb SSD

2TB HDD



I have no monitors connected to the integrated graphics ports. I have the following 5 monitors (all at native resolutions) connected to the RX 480:

DP port 1: 1920x1200; daisy-chained 1080x1920 (portrait orientation)

DP port 2: 1920x1200

DP port 3: 1920x1080

HDMI port: 2160x3840 (portrait orientation)



This monitor configuration is somewhat unstable. When the computer wakes from sleep, sometimes all the monitors wake up, sometimes 1 will not wake (not always the same monitor) - I can usually wake the sleeping monitor by going into Windows 10 Display Settings, where Windows thinks the monitor is connected and awake, disable the monitor and then re-enable it. Even when the computer is running, very occasionally a monitor will drop out and go to sleep.



All the cables work fine with fewer monitors, so it's not obvious that it's a cable quality problem. But maybe when you're pushing the system, cable quality requirement is higher?



Is it possible this config is too much for the Radeon card? If that's the case, what is the best option for making this 5 monitor setup more stable? If possible, I'd like to add a 6th monitor.



I could move 1 or 2 monitors to the integrated graphics ports and enable integrated graphics in BIOS, but I'm guessing this is likely to result in BSOD's - this is what happened every week or so on my last couple of Dell XPS systems where I used both integrated and discrete graphics simultaneously.



Maybe add another card without large power requirements (so that I don't have to upgrade PSU from stock unit)? Maybe something like the Nvidia NVS 510?

By decreasing the resolution you are biasing toward a more CPU-bound performance situation.  Increasing the resolution moves it to a GPU-bound situation.

The i5-2400 is based on Sandy Bridge and is a superior architecture compared to Core 2.

This is the first one that can easily maintain the lower refresh rate I run at 1080p.  You can spend more and get the RTX 2060 if you want those features, ray tracing, better encoder.

I am new to the site, so apologize if this is a duplication.  I did a bit of a search, and couldn't find specific answers.



I am not a gamer, but instead use my laptop for CAD work, including full color renderings, ""fly-thrus"", etc, and I want to maximize that process.

Currently have a laptop with these specs:

Intel i7-8750 CPU @ 2.2GHz

16GB RAM

500GB in C drive

2TB in D drive

Invidia GTX 1070 card



What would a good upgrade be (to any of the components if applicable), but specifically to the GTX 1070?



Thanks in advance for any recommendations!

You can also  buy a Thunderbolt 3 external dock, but then you need to make sure you buy a laptop with a a full x4 dedicated slot for Thunderbolt expansion bus (you're going to need the bandwidth to feed a fast card).



https://3dinsider.com/thunderbolt-3-external-gpus/



But the upside Thunderbolt 3 is it's a universal standard, so you should be able to continue to upgrade cards/reuse the enclosure.



Do you think you could cart around an expansion box?  You could always leave it in your car, and only break nit out when you  need to do ma demanding render."

My beloved Samsung 67"" DLP finally kicked the can recently, so I had to get a quick replacement.  My local Costco had a good deal on a QN75Q6DRAFXZA with white glove shipping, so it's now sitting in my house.



Thing is, it's FAR more modern than the motherboard to which it is attached (an ASRock Z97 Extreme6).  According to the manual, this particular ASRock has an undisclosed HDMI spec that can only output 3840x2160 @ 30 Hz.  It also has DisplayPort 1.2, but that doesn't help much since the TV only has HDMI ports and the 1.2 spec in and of itself is also fairly old.  Besides, I'm sure I need to completely bypass the Intel HD 4600 graphics subsystem.



So, it looks like to take full advantage of the TV, I'll have to get a dedicated GPU.  Can anyone recommend a card that has the latest HDMI spec for HDR viewing?  I won't be gaming on this system, as it's my HTPC, so just a minimum-spec card will do just for watching 4K content.  Either green or red is fine.  Prefer something around $50, if possible.



Thanks in advance."

			System specs:

Dell XPS 8900

Core i7-6700 @ 4GHz

32gb DDR4 RAM

Intel HD Graphics 530 (integrated)

AMD Radeon RX 480 8gb

256gb SSD

2TB HDD



I have no monitors connected to the integrated graphics ports. I have the following 5 monitors (all at native resolutions) connected to the RX 480:

DP port 1: 1920x1200; daisy-chained 1080x1920 (portrait orientation)

DP port 2: 1920x1200

DP port 3: 1920x1080

HDMI port: 2160x3840 (portrait orientation)



This monitor configuration is somewhat unstable. When the computer wakes from sleep, sometimes all the monitors wake up, sometimes 1 will not wake (not always the same monitor) - I can usually wake the sleeping monitor by going into Windows 10 Display Settings, where Windows thinks the monitor is connected and awake, disable the monitor and then re-enable it. Even when the computer is running, very occasionally a monitor will drop out and go to sleep.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Wanted to follow up on this. I swapped out the Radeon card for two Nvidia NVS 510 cards. Been a few weeks and this change seems to have resolved two issues:

1. monitors not all waking up from sleep. Since the swap, all monitors reliably wake up from sleep

2. occasionally a monitor drops out while PC is running. Since the swap, this has not happened.



One issue that remained was a couple of monitors occasionally have very brief instances of distortions/flashing on parts of the screen. I swapped out those DP cables for Accel DP cables and that issue seems to be resolved.



And as a bonus, I added a 6th monitor (2k monitor). So now I've got:

2 x 1920x1080

2 x 1920x1200

1 x 2560x1440

1 x 3840x2160



Only display issue I have is some windows will be rearranged upon waking from sleep, but from my experience and what I've read, this issue has always plagued Windows multi-monitor setups using DisplayPort. It's annoying, but not a big deal. And I do run DisplayFusion, which may exacerbate things, but I recall I had this issue even before I started using DisplayFusion.



As for suggestions to use HDMI or DVI, this isn't an option once you ramp up the number of monitors. On many cards,  you are limited to a max of 2 HDMI and or DVI connections. So for 5 or 6 monitor setups, you have to use DP."

How much did you get, and which card did you sell?



I had my 1080 Ti up for sale locally for about a week before someone bought it. Initially listed it for $500 (I knew people would haggle). Then, I dropped it to $450, since no one was serious. It sat at $450 for a few days until a guy offered me $420 for it. The only reason I sold it was because I picked up a mint Radeon 5700 for $200 locally, which is holding me off just fine. I figure I'll get my $200 back out of it once I snag a 3xxx series card, so it was a free rental. I loved my 1080 Ti, but since I preordered the new HP Reverb G2 headset, I know I'll need more horsepower to push it. I figured I might as well get the most out of the 1080 Ti, while I could. $420 locally is equivalent to about $500 on ebay, after fees and shipping, and no BS to put up with."

			Yeah, 4K is pretty nice but we are approaching a limit. For example, monitors have been getting larger, but there is a limit on what is comfortable on a desk (which is probably in the 30 - 40"" range).



Similarly, 4K on a 40"" screen looks great. I'm sure 8K is cool, but it can't look 4 times better, at least not given the same screen size / distance and the boundaries of human perception.



I think it will be like audio. I mean, we have been using basically the same standards for decades, and while there have been improvements (like surround sound) we are still not that far away from when CDs came out in the 80's.

For me 32"" is the perfect size since you can see the full screen without panning and it is great for productivity as well.  Ultimately once we get to 32"" HDR 4K 144hz I dont really see me going past that. I know these are coming this year, but not sure I can do the $3500 price tag but they should come down in price.  I personally would rather game at 4K 60fps than 1440 at 144Hz but that is just me, so I need it in a 4K monitor."

Keep in mind too that the power budgets on GPUs exploded during that time. For all intents and purposes, the AGP slot was only designed to push 50W of power. I just looked up some info and the Ti4600 reference card didn't have any auxiliary power connectors on it, so obviously that card was < 50W draw. The 5800 series was a big leap as it required external power, and also needed to cool that beast. I'm not sure if anyone had a shroud cooler like that before the 5800 came out, so it might have been the original pioneer in that market.

So show me your build for $600 CDN ( 441.52 USD )?



This is my first time using an NVMe drive. I've read that people basically fried their NVMe by not using a custom heatsink ( all it comes with is a thin, copper heat spreader under the sticker ).



If it was just a regular 500 MB/s SSD or even a HDD, I wouldn't worry about fans that much.



The parts + fans + NVMe heatsink already put me over budget by $250 CDN or so.



When I bought the Corsair case, I didn't realise that it would only come with 1 shitty (made in China) 1K RPM rear exhause fan so that was my mistake. There are 2 front fans, 2 top fans and after removing the hard drive cage, you can even mount one on the case floor. I had already planned to subsidize anything past the $600 CDN mark."

			For Solidworks, depending on your model size, you can get away with integrated intel graphics.   I use a couple of basic systems for modeling parts for my cnc.  The laptop in this picture is almost 10 years old.  Most of the parts on the mini cnc were modeled in Solidworks  and 3d printed.  Quadro features can also be enabled by creating a REGISTRY entry in the graphics section.  You can enable realview rendering for example, as well as full scene antialiasing.  If your main use will be for training/hobbyist then bare minimum will suffice.  For rendering and plex server, obviously you want fastest cpu/gpu you can manage.

Huh.  I hadn't seen that one.  It's interesting that the only thing he had to change was the DrMOS package.  Your card definitely has something else wrong, since it keeps killing them.  I actually replaced it again after I posted about it yesterday, and it killed that one after just a few seconds.



I feel like the problem pretty much has to be related to the bootstrap circuit, but I can't find anything obviously wrong with it.  I gave up on it for a while yesterday afternoon, but I'll look at it again soon.

			The CX650M is a semi modular PSU.  650W should be plenty for your 5700xt.  What do you mean when you say extended cables?  It should have come with 2 sets of PCI-E cables to plug in.  You can use both to connect your GPU, but it shouldn't make much difference as the PSU is only a single rail anyways, so feeding with 1 or 2 cables it's still all from a common 12v rail.  I am wondering what you mean by extended cables though, if you use and extension it could be having issues with getting enough power to the GPU through them.  Why couldn't you plug them in directly?  They should be plenty long in most any case.  Are you sure you used the PCI-E connectors and plugged into the correct spot on the PSU?  There is nothing wrong with that PSU for your use, so something else is causing the issues (how it's connected, make sure it's fully seating in PCI-E slot and locked, etc).

I availed myself of the super handy Probe-It connector for most of the rail measurements.  I also confirmed these readings at the real components closer to the logic.



We've got a sane, if not exactly high, VCore.  This is ~930mV or .93V.  Spec is something like .7 to 1.2, so the card should be able to run on this.

Vmem is present, but a bit below spec.  We've got 1.409V here; spec is 1.5.  This may be the reason our card doesn't run.  On most GPU designs, there's an enable signal that the VRMs are supposed to provide to the GPU to indicate that they're ready, which they won't provide if the voltage is low.

VPll looks OK.  This is 1.05 volts

And our 12V reading on the Probe-It connector.  I later figured out that this is supplied by the PCI-E connector, not the 8 pins.

			That's interesting and explains something, when I was first troubleshooting and trying different PSU, powering on with either one PCI-E cable,etc. I had also tried no cables to see if I could get one of those friendly ""please plug in the power cables messages"", the mosfet may have actually burned up (or at least burned more) in that cycle as that one had visible smoke.

Interesting.  I suspect it tried to power the card fully via that MOSFET when you tried to power it up that way, and because the VRM was in short, it tried to draw essentially unlimited amps (in reality, probably more like 30 or so).



Anyway, I got interrupted mid-stream  a few days ago.  After I installed the heatsink, it was time to test the board for basic function.  I wanted to do this as soon as I could in order to make sure I wasn't just spinning my wheels.  So, I plugged it in to the system, hit the button and was greeted with signs of life!

Next, it's time to fix the damage to the power balancing circuit on the back of the board.  



First, I trimmed the damaged trace material off and removed the conformal coating from the what remained by scraping with the blunt back edge of an x-acto knife.

Then, I made some new traces out of copper tape.  Here, they're soaking in isopropanol to remove the adhesive.

I epoxied the new traces on the board using CircuitWorks CW2500 high temperature epoxy, which is the green stuff you see in this photo.

The epoxy is fully cured now, and it's time to reflow the solder under it to fully connect the traces, and then install the FET back on them.  Fingers crossed, I'll make time to do that this evening."

I would tend to agree that the 1660 series is essentially the same performance as the 1070 series.  You get slightly less power draw but you also get less VRAM with the 1660s.  Unfortunately, that's the state of the market right now that a 1070Ti is $280.  I've bought several 1080's 6 months ago for essentially the same price."

It's good advice to avoid DP to HDMI converters. Going the new GPU route is the smart move.



HDR should be fine, but you should do research to ensure your particular flavor is supported. The Nvidia 10 series can handle 8k 10bit HEVC and 12bit vp9. That should cover most sources.



The GT 1030 checks a lot of boxes, but some streaming apps (i.e. Netflix) use DRM that doesn't play well with it. You'll need to spend a little more for the 1050 if you care about 4k Netflix."

			I should address some common questions and concerns here. -MOST LIKELY I did not actually kill the 5800 Ultra. Possible issues might be bad voltage/current regulation or cracked solder connections due to trauma (handling from mail carrier for example) or another cause. -The fan on the 5800 Ultra was NEVER turned off completely. It was briefly set at 34% at the lowest, 50% the rest of the time. -The card did not overheat. Temp was in the low 40s Celcius according to RivaTuner. -I did not touch the clockspeed settings. -I'm not crazy about the 5800 Ultra because it's good. Far from it. I'm crazy about it because it IS terrible, and exceptionally rare. It has amazing historical value in the world of consumer 3D graphics. -The 5800 Ultra does NOT work if that wasn't clear. So no, I will not test it against a Radeon 9700 Pro or similar unless it can be fixed. -The test system for the Riva 128ZX wasn't shown. It was my Windows 98SE PC. It IS equipped with a Universal AGP slot capable of 3.3v. Compatibility issues may be the result of a BIOS setting, an incompatible BIOS version, or even the chipset (VIA KT333). -Yes I have freakish (awesome) double jointed thumbs. It is the future evolution of human hands.

For example: 



970 GTX were being sold for $25 to $75 in used market 6 months ago.. Now $70 to $150? wth??????

Almost 0 distinction between 1650/Super/1660/1660 ti etc... You're only paying for the ""brand new"" sticker price. I've seen price range from $200 to $500 usd ????

A  used 1070 GTX ,the value card.. Used to be had for $140-200 dollars. Now at $220-250 buy it now prices???? So why would people get a 1650 or 1660 when a 1070 is superior? boggles my mind.

Ok the hidden gem the used 1080 ti. Okay at least I can get one for $500-550 like years ago. At least this market is still the same.

			Gpu was always running good even after buying the psu and temps were just as fine as before. Only later it becomes like this and maybe the only thing to look at was the bumping of 50%+ wattage and that is now off since yesterday when i made factory reset from radeon setting and also msi afterburner.

			YCbCr uses limited range color.  This is how the color space works.  If you use a YCbCr format then make sure the black level on your TV is set accordingly.  RGB can be set to limited or full range, so again, set your black level accordingly.

When you use Ycbcr most TV's autodetect the correct black level, so it is a pretty much fool proof method for people who are not savvy with stuff like this.



That said, for PC you want to use RGB because most PC content uses RGB. This way you avoid unnecessary back and forth conversions. But for your bluray player in your home theater you want to use Ycbcr if there is one in the settings because that is the format movies are in. Again to avoid unnecessary conversions."

On the bench today, we have an EVGA GeForce 980 Ti SC, which has this handsome axial flow cooler, but is otherwise a run of the mill nVidia reference design 980 Ti, with a slightly faster BIOS.  This card was sent to me by a Hardforum reader, who I won't call out, but he's welcome to chime in.  Before he sent the card to me, he told me that it doesn't work, and prevents the system from starting when it's plugged in.  Those of you who have read my other threads are probably aware that that is a classic symptom of a short to ground on one of the 12V power input rails, so that's where we're going to start our diagnostics.

First, we obviously have two 12V connectors, plus the PCI-E connector's 12V pins, so we need to confirm that that's our problem, and figure out which one is the culprit.

Let's try the big one first.  Yep.  That's definitely a short.

The other rail looks ok.  This is higher than one usually sees, but higher is better than lower.



So, about that shorted rail...  Who can tell us what the significance of that resistance value is?"

As for the video card I wouldn't spend more than $200-$250 on a new one for this system. That will put you in the GTX 1660 Super price point. If you're wanting to try AMD look for a RX 5500XT 8GB card. Either would be quite a upgrade from your GTX 960."

			What's happening in the GPU market?   My last purchase was a 1080TI FE back in 3/2017 for $699 back then and I'm not seeing any compelling reason to upgrade.  It looks like the AMD alternative is the RX5700 XT and Nvidia's is the RTX 2080TI.   The AMD might match the 1080TI but still might be a bit behind and the 2080TI can beat it but costs $1200+ for what I consider a modest performance gain.  Are we in  the same type of market that we were with Intel CPU's in the years before Ryzen?   No reason to upgrade until multiple generations of GPU improvements?

If that is the case, a laptop with 2070 Super non max q or 2080 non max q will help a lot in any GPU rendering. Though it is only available for Intel laptops for the time being, I haven't seen any laptop paired with a AMD CPU yet. I have not seen any laptops available with a 2080 Super non max q variant. Though defaultuser does have a point, if you don't need to lug a laptop for work, 4k goes a lot farther if you are building a desktop."

That isn't a ""max limit"" as in ""max thermal limit for safe function""; it's just a target temperature at which the card will begin to stop holding boost clocks/voltages and start dropping them in order to maintain that temp.



The card is definitely running warmer than what the cooler is capable of, but that's just because the case is cramped and has inadequate exhaust airflow to remove the heat. Those type of GPU coolers like what your SC Ultra has just dump heat back into the surrounding space, so your case has to be setup with decent exhaust nearby to get rid of it, which is the reason why most prebuilt system use cards with blower-type coolers that expel the heat out from the PCI bracket area.



Looking at pics of your case, the default setup is just a single exhaust fan in the back and no intake on the front, despite there being mounting holes for one. You might want to install one there to feed some cool air into the system, because as it currently stands, your components are being forced to slowly suck up air from the gaps and openings in the case, at the same time that they are dumping heat into the immediate vicinity. That's going to lead to bad times."

Exactly.  I could see a ~$900-1100 2080Ti being a $550-600 card and the 2080 being a $350-400 based on price leaks and the leaked specs up and down the lineup.  It absolutely makes sense to offload one now rather than later IF you are betting that the 3XXX performance is going to be significantly better.  It sounds like Nvidia is planning a 3070 with similar specs to the 2080 Super for $400-500.  Throw in an assumed RTX improvement and lower power consumption, and I wouldn't even give someone $350 for a 2080 Super.

Modern IGPs are far more capable than they were 15-20 years ago, and are more than capable of playing back 4K YouTube videos and decoding H.264/H.265.

You mean this one?



You're right that that's basically the same problem, but his is obviously way worse - so bad in fact that he had to grind away a large portion of the board to clear the short, and only got it working about the same as I did.



The real problem that he had, and he didn't really address, is why this happens in the first place.  I think he probably assumed, like I did originally, that the failure is the result of hamfisted overclocking, but it's obviously not if your card just died while it was idling."

Prices has dropped at the start of this year, then went way down for a short period of time when the initial Covid 19 panic started, then prices gradually went up and up and up as stores sold out.

madVR FAQ has a nice section on this:








	
	
		
		
			Windows internally always ""thinks"" in RGB 0-255. Windows considers black to be 0 and white to be 255. That applies to the desktop, applications, games and videos. Windows itself never really thinks in terms of YCbCr or 16-235. Windows does know that videos might be YCbCr or 16-235, but still, all rendering is always done at RGB 0-255. (The exception proves the rule.)



So if you switch your GPU control panel to RGB 0-255, the GPU receives RGB 0-255 from Windows, and sends RGB 0-255 to the TV. Consequently, the GPU doesn't have to do any colorspace (RGB -> YCbCr) or range (0-255 -> 16-235) conversions. This is the best setup, because the GPU won't damage our precious pixels.



If you switch your GPU control panel to RGB 16-235, the GPU receives RGB 0-255 from Windows, but you ask the GPU to send 16-235 to the TV. Consequently, the GPU has to stretch the pixel data behind Windows' back in such a way that a black pixel is no longer 0, but now 16. And a white pixel is no longer 255, but now 235. So the pixel data is condensed from 0-255 to 16-235, and all the values between 0-15 and 236-255 are basically unused. Some GPU drivers might do this in high bitdepth with dithering, which may produce acceptable results. But some GPU drivers definitely do this in 8bit without any dithering which will introduce lots of nasty banding artifacts into the image. As a result I cannot recommend this configuration.



If you switch your GPU control panel to YCbCr, the GPU receives RGB from Windows, but you ask the GPU to send YCbCr to the TV. Consequently, the GPU has to convert the RGB pixels behind Windows' back to YCbCr. Some GPU drivers might do this in high bitdepth with dithering, which may produce acceptable results. But some GPU drivers definitely do this in 8bit without any dithering which will introduce lots of nasty banding artifacts into the image. Furthermore, there are various different RGB <-> YCbCr matrixes available. E.g. there's one each for BT.601, BT.709 and BT.2020. Now which of these will the GPU use for the conversion? And which will the TV use to convert back to RGB? If the GPU and the TV use different matrixes, color errors will be introduced. As a result I cannot recommend this configuration.



Summed up: In order to get the best possible image quality, I strongly recommend to set your GPU control panel to RGB Full (0-255).

			At that pricepoint you’re usually way better off buying a prebuilt and slapping in a cheap GPU.

He doesn't need a GPU because he doesn't do gaming or download movies or ... well... do hardly anything. Get this... he already has a laptop. I asked him why he needs a desktop if he already has a laptop? His answer didn't make a lot of sense, he said something about power (???). He has the desktop set up in the basement.



The price difference between SATA and NVMe is $30 CDN ish but 6x / 4x faster.



My dad sent me a diagram of the dimensions that he wanted ( 14.5 inch long x 10.5 inch high x 4 inch wide ). In retrospect, really what he wanted was a cross between a mini-PC and a prebuilt.





I saw this ChuWi larkbox after I ordered the parts ( even though I spent a lot of time trying to figure out an ITX build, I didn't even realise that mini-PCs were a thing ):



Downsides: 30 day warranty from China; some kind of proprietary power supply; some kind of problem with SATA cabling:




	
		
	


In retrospect, I could have got a pre-built ( on sale: saves $150 CDN ) from Staples ( it would come with a Win 10 license - huge cost saving ). It would have come with a 7200 RPM HDD but I could have simply added an NVMe and just turned off the power to the HDD and used it for archival storage. I could have swapped out the slim DVD for a slim DVD burner. I would have saved on the cost of the Noctua fans ( $200 CDN ) and the time that I spent building the thing ( although the case is awesome for cable management and has more utility than my 10 year old, expensive Lian Li full tower gaming case - by necessity ).



I have more experience in what not to do, when it comes to building.



Edit: I had to order a special magnifier because I couldn't read the writing for the pinouts on the motherboard ( micro ATX motherboard is tiny ):



https://www.amazon.ca/Carson-Hand-Held-Hands-Free-Magnifier-FH-25/dp/B002R332T4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Carson+Freehand+2.5X+LED+Lighted+Hand-Held+or+Hands-Free+Magnifier+with+5.5X+Spot+Lens+(FH-25)&qid=1594593787&sr=8-1



Edit: I also forgot to mention that the i-860 that you guys built 10 years ago is still working ( I use it for high end gaming 24/ 7 ). I never expected it to last this long but I plan on replacing it maybe the end of this year or next year, depending on Intel pulling their fingers out of their butt. Also depends on the NVIDIA 3000 series video cards coming out. That's why I was interested in what the deal is with NVMe & PCIe 4.0.



My ( 7 year old ish ) Samsung 840 Pro started randomly pausing for fractions of a second while gaming ( sometimes as long as 2 seconds ) and the hard drive light is on, like it's constantly trying to access the drive. The drive is almost full and the speeds are sequential read: 204 MB / s and sequential write: 130 MB /s, which is pretty terrible. I'm going to see if installing Win 10 fixes the drive because I have not formated this drive in 7 years or something."

What happens if you take the case panel off?  Does it run cooler?  



Also, have you looked inside the case to see if it's just dirty?  You need to vacuum the dust out of there every once in a while, particularly on pre-builts that often have small vents.



87 degrees isn't so hot that you need to worry that much.  I'd hold off replacing the case until you figure out that the case is the reason it's running hot now."

Also, make sure the card is getting sufficient air flow in the case.  If the case and heat sinks are dusty, cables aren’t properly managed, etc, the card will have a hard time accessing fresh cool air and exhausting heat.



Additionally, if the PSU is bottom mount, make sure the fan is mounted down.  Drawing air from the inside of the case will pull some air away from the GPU.  That probably won’t be the sole reason for a temperate spike, but it can contribute."

well if you like details...

I've been out of the pc enthusiast scene for a long time now. I built a few pc's in the 00's and early 2010's, (think core 2 duo - sandy bridge era)... that's when I knew a lot about pc hardware. 



Life happens (went to prison, had a kid, etc.) and I stopped caring so much to keep up with pc hardware. I was a net admin throughout my 20's (turned software dev) so my focus switched towards enterprise grade gear and solutions. 

Finally I now have the time and extra money sitting around to get back into some things I used to like... one of those being pc gaming.



Until now, I was using a store bought HP Pavillion with a gen8 i5, upgraded ram (16gb) and a GTX 1050 2gb. These were all just extra things I had lying around to make the pavilion a little more capable. 

Surprisingly, it held up pretty well and could play almost everything I threw at it pretty well. Use your common sense, the witcher 3 had to be run on low settings and was still a little bit choppy, but I don't always play AAA games with sweet graphics. 



Compared to the HP, i'm sure it will be able to handle games much more easily. I haven't even tried the 1070 yet, as I'm still getting the rig up and running. 

Because I was already in the market to build a new pc, (I would have gone with some RTX variant) I wanted to know if it's worth keeping this thing around. If it's going to leave me wanting, I'll sell it. If it'll play 90% of the stuff out there on high or close to max without a problem, I'll keep it around.



The whole thing kinda fell into my lap- I wanted to go with a Ryzen setup, alas here I am with another 8th gen i5... albeit a little faster."

DisplayPort++ (dual mode) should only need a passive dongle (no chip), the conversion should be handled by the card.  These are cheaper, but the card must support dual/multimode.



If in doubt, use active converters since they will work on both regular and dual mode DisplayPorts.



If you need dual-link DVI, make sure the dongle supports dual-link DVI out (may vary by manufacturer).



---

""DisplayPort has a function known as “Dual-Mode” or “DisplayPort++/DP++” which allows other signal types to be passed through the DisplayPort connector, including TMDS which is the signaling required by HDMI and DVI displays. According to above reason, there are two main types of DisplayPort converter in the market:



* Active Adapters: Active adapters use additional chips to make the conversion inside the adapter, regardless of whether the source supports DP++. This means that active adapters are more expensive than passive adapters.

* Passive Adapters: Passive adapters are less expensive since they do not need to include additional chips. A quick way to check whether you can use a passive adapter is to see if the DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort source has the DP++ symbol above it."

My solution was to make it so my computer never sleeps, i have power settings so that my monitors turn off but not my computer. Still, on reboots, I need to rearrange a few things every single damn time.



I've noticed that for whatever reason, having the leftmost monitor be primary tends to fix a lot of the random window moving around.  I used to use software like displayfusion but it ended up causing more problems after a certain Windows 10 patch (a year or two ago?)



As for a monitor dropping out while the PC is running - change out the cable.  That fixed that one for me.  A cheap displayport cable would lose signal to my cheap 4k60 monitor for whatever reason.   New cable, hasn't happened since.  (Which is good, because I thought the Monitor was dieing before i decided to try a new cable.)"

This would only matter in a 2-rail PSU (this is a single 12v RAIL PSU, so using 2 cables = 1 rail) or if you have a cable that is falling apart (which means you shouldn't be using it single or double).  If you have 2 cables though, you might as well use them, but this isn't the issue.  If it fixes the issue, then there is an issue with the way you have it connected or the cable/extension you were using."

I play games very sporadically, I would say a few times a year.  What I mostly do is editing photos and video's.  I use mainly Premiere Pro, Photoshop, InPixio Photo Focus, and recently have started experimenting with Topaz Giga Video and Photo AI, and Dain-App.



I currently have 16Gb of Ram and a Ryzen 5 3500.  I am planning on upgrading at least the Ram if not the whole combo in the next few months



Giga Video and Dain are massive obstacles right now, but I never see any benchmarks on them to see what would help.  Dain uses the video card memory and right now I'm very limited as it really struggles with one 4GB of ram on the 1500.  Giga Video is the biggest place I would like improvment.  I just did my parents ripped from DVD wedding video which was 54 mins long, and to get it up to HD took my combo 5 and a half days to do.



My thoughts were because I don't game, maybe trying to find a used Quadro card but looking at benches of common apps it seems most modern gaming cards do just fine against them at a lower price.



So should I be looking at a RTX2070 8G, a 1080 TI 11G or a Quadro?  Something else?  It has to be Nvidia because DAIN requires CUDA.

			Hi RazorWind.  I've got an EVGA GTX 980Ti with the same issues reported here, as soon as I apply plug in the 8pin power connector it keeps my system from powering on.  I've troubleshot it to the 12v pins being shorted...likely a mosfet issue.  I've taken the card apart and there is no visible damage anywhere.  If there was, I'd try to replace that component.  However, with there being no visible damage anywhere, my skills are not good enough to troubleshoot further.  Would you want me to send this one to you to take a look at as well?  Next step is trash.  It's been sitting here for a few months now and I'd like to fix it to put in my son's computer.  If you can't fix it, oh well.  I've read your terms and am fine with them.  Given this one has no visible indicators of damage, I figure it may be a good one to show us how you troubleshoot it to figure out where the actual problem is.

			What's happening in the GPU market?   My last purchase was a 1080TI FE back in 3/2017 for $699 back then and I'm not seeing any compelling reason to upgrade.  It looks like the AMD alternative is the RX5700 XT and Nvidia's is the RTX 2080TI.   The AMD might match the 1080TI but still might be a bit behind and the 2080TI can beat it but costs $1200+ for what I consider a modest performance gain.  Are we in  the same type of market that we were with Intel CPU's in the years before Ryzen?   No reason to upgrade until multiple generations of GPU improvements?

Correct.



AMD is not competitive at the high end. Nvidia has no need to innovate since nobody can touch them. Prices are going up due to lac of competition.



Like you mentioned, this is exactly the same thing that happened to Intel between when they released Sandy Bridge all the way through to when AMD released Ryzen. 



Hopefully Intel and AMD can put release high end GPUs this year to compete with Intel."

They work on lots of cards, though some definitely wouldn't fit.  Honestly you could achieve similar results just by buying 4 long screws and some nuts/washers with a 120-140mm AIO.

That said, you're likely sacrificing of some of the performance if it's still bouncing against 87C even despite it throttling. If you're using the stock Intel cooler on your i7-7700 then it's dumping heat into your case that the 1660 Super is sucking up. I'd recommend upgrading that to an AIO to get that hot air out. I can see your mounting options are extremely limited, so a 120mm AIO with a thicker radiator (e.g. Arctic Liquid Freezer II 120mm) and configure it to exhaust out of the back. The front and side vents will basically be passive intake, but with some ingenuity you can probably still setup a front intake fan (e.g. use long screws to reach past the RGB bar, 3D print a bracket, zip-ties, etc.)."

I've had problems with both of them. I like their motherboards (running one in my personal machine now), but I wouldn't buy their graphics cards with my own money. One of them has a terrible RMA history that sounds like some of those ASUS horror stories that make you shudder when you hear them.



The first one is a 980Ti that just quit working one day. Black screen, no video output on any connector. I threw it in a system on my test bench and duplicated the problem on a couple boards. It was RMA'ed to MSI. They sent it back saying it tested good and sent it back to my friend with bent the fins on the heat sink. The guy who had it before me had already replaced it and he gave me the card. It worked for a few days before going tits up again. I had him contact MSI before it died about the messed up heat sink and they pretty much said ""no we didn't"" and ""it works doesn't it, quit crying about it."" When it went belly up I had no money in it and my buddy had moved on to another card, so I just threw it in a cabinet where it sits today.  



The second is an MSI RTX 2080 Super Gaming X-Trio that the FPSReview covered a few months back. After a few weeks on my test bench, it basically would shoot up to 100c almost the instant you fired up a game. Obviously, nothing was stable like that. So, test cards we are sent for review have no warranty on them. I ended up pulling the heat sink apart (PITA) and reapplying thermal paste. It looks like it had been applied by ""that friend"" who gets drunk at parties and pisses everywhere but inside the toilet bowl."

Just skip a gen. It's what I did with the 2000 series. I saw the performance gains and the ""newness"" of RTX as a tax. Not that I disagreed with the direction, I just didn't see the point yet. I got a used 1080 for $300. No complaints about the performance I'm getting. I got a good deal. I'm more inclined to purchase a 3000 now that more and more things are supporting the feature set. So, I feel my money is better spent. But, I'm gaming at 1440p. So, I'm not eying the 3080ti. Though, I might aim higher if I decide to get an Index...but I'm thinking I'll wait for the next revision of the Index."

If it's native or bust, you better do your research. I'm not sure there are guarantees out there. So be prepared for that.



As for HDMI to DVI Dual Link at QHD 60Hz resolution? Forget it. HDMI doesn't physically support dual link. I've done a ton of research over the years, and such a thing simply doesn't exist. It's like a magical unicorn or something. Most who claim they got it to work at QHD 60Hz are pretty much full of shit. Maybe QHD at a significantly reduced refresh rate. The best you can hope for is single link bandwidth over HDMI, which will not get you to that coveted 2560x1440 @ 60Hz native resolution. Converting HDMI to DVI Dual Link would require all sorts of processing, and most likely add delay, so even if such a thing existed, it wouldn't be cheap nor ideal for gaming.



DisplayPort is another matter. DisplayPort can physically support dual link channels. I've seen enough convincing success stories of Active DisplayPort to DVI Dual Link pulling off 2560x1440@60Hz, that I know it's a thing. But from what I can gather, and it's been a year since I last looked into this, it's going to be a YMMV scenario. It's going to depend on how nice everything plays together.



Between HDMI and DP, an Active DisplayPort to DVI Dual Link adapter is your best bet."

			They work on lots of cards, though some definitely wouldn't fit.  Honestly you could achieve similar results just by buying 4 long screws and some nuts/washers with a 120-140mm AIO.  Since this would only be for testing purposes the only thing you would really need is solid contact.  After installing one myself recently I realized how rudimentary the setup is and how much easier it is to install/remove than the stock HSF.

You know, now that I think about it, I have two 295X2 cooling units (four gpus' worth of water cooling!) lying around from cards I couldn't save.  They have an oddball screw spacing that doesn't even fit other AMD cards, but I bet if I can get my hands on an nvidia-shape bracket, I could rejigger one to serve test bench duty.  That's a good idea to use a CLC.

I'm cautiously optimistic.  12nm to 7nm is ~3x as many transistors for a given die size.  Assuming pascal is 50/50 shading and raytracing, the rumor mill claiming +50% shading and 4x faster ray tracing is plausible.  Shading would go from 0.5 pascals of transistors to 0.75, ray tracing from 0.5 to 2.0 for a total of 2.75x as many transistors as pascal has.  That fits comfortably within the 3x larger transistor budget, and leaves room for either adding other things (eg more or bigger and faster memory controllers, or more video en/decode options), or a slight step back in die size from the monsters that powered the 2000 series.



Even if the rumor mill is overstating it by a factor of two, it'll finally be enough to justify replacing my 1080, so I'm almost certainly going to be buying a 3080/ti later this year."

There are cheaper options, such as the 1050 that would also do what you need, but they may be harder to find at this point.  Used RX580s are also abundant and pretty cheap, but they generally require more power, and may necessitate a power supply upgrade.

			I would have believed it if ""Big Ampere"" wasn't released already. But it seems nvidia has consolidated top to bottom. After Volta/Turing.  They are still missing a SoC for their self driving/AI/robotics solutions, so there's that.



I do think nvidia could come up with a ""tweaked ampere refresh"" on a smaller process if its viable.

Yeah, still using the same adapter. One odd thing that just started happening, now if you leave your computer on 24/7 after like a week+ it will start artifacting but if I unplug it and plug it back everything goes back to normal. It has been plugged in and on, none stop for over a yr."

With no offense intended, you should stop messing with it before you make it worse.  I gather you did that with a soldering iron?



I'd have to have the card in my hands to say for sure, but I suspect that's probably still salvageable, assuming there isn't any other damage.  I don't offer graphics card repairs as a service for hire, mainly for the reason that it isn't really practical to do as a business, but also because I fail more often than I succeed, as was the case with the card in this thread.  That said, I once offered to look at a card for another [H] member for free, with the understanding that the possibility exists I may it worse, and that I'd make some content for the forum and Youtube.



If you're OK with those terms, I could probably offer the same deal to you.  That would be a pretty good way for this thread to conclude, now that I think about it."

Have you set a custom fan curve in Afterburner? 



Most cards come with bunk fan defaults that will run the card hot and throttle. You'll need to set a custom curve. I usually do 100% fan at 80C down to 50% at 40C, you can play with the curve in-between.



Also, 87C is not dangerous. The GPUs can run up to 90C safely. As long as it's below that you should be fine."

			Oh sorry, I saw crazycrave posted the CX650M, thought that was you saying that got myself confused!  Yeah... that 350w PSU is probably having issues keeping up with the power requirements.



According to AMD

https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/radeon-rx-5700-series-quick-start-guide-en.pdf

"" Minimum 600W (recommended 700W) PSU with up to an 8-pin + 6-pin PCI Express Auxiliary connectors. This PSU recommendation is only for one Radeon RX 5700 series GPU installed per system. Additional GPUs will require more capable power supplies.""



Your 350w is not going to cut it.  That CX650M was probably supposed to be a suggestion from crazycrave.  It's like $95 from Best Buy so you can get local.  Semi modular so you don't have a bunch of unnecessary cables laying around.  You can find cheapers ones too, but it would work well.  That said, the 5700xt does use more power than a 5700 and you could probably get by with 500w (namebrand) PSU but I woudn't chance it.  I would get a decent one that won't give you issues in the future.  If you need help locating a decent one let us know your budget and if you were trying to find something local or are ok with newegg or amazon or new/used, etc.  The game works with your on board because it's not pulling so many watts.

			Here's a casual observation.  At launch, the 1080Ti was essentially equal to the 2080 which was disappointing at best (I cancelled my 2080 pre-order when I saw reviews).  Now, a 1080Ti can barely keep up with a 2070.  Why is that?  Nvidia wants you to buy a 2070 instead of a used 1080Ti and isn't putting in the effort to optimize for Pascal cards.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Alternative suggestion:  Optimization for new hardware takes time too - so they're finding more things that they can do on the 2XXX that they couldn't on the 1XXX, and the 1000-series is already had most of its optimizations.  (Also, the game devs have more time to find tricks/things they can do they couldn't before, and better tuning, etc).  See:  Consoles, early games vs later ones in terms of quality.  Once you figure out tricks to make the hardware do more than it could before, you use those.  



Now I agree Nvidia probably isn't investing time on the 1xxx series cards anymore, but there's more to that story too - multiple actors, if you will."

There is no way you only top out at 60c if it's under full load and overclocked. Even at the out of the box clocks 60c would be impossible unless you have a VERY aggressive fan profile that you are using. Heck even their Gaming X cards don't even run that low on temperatures.



Edit: Yep 67c under full gaming load even with the 3 fan Gaming X. https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-2070-super-gaming-x-trio/31.html

			The CX650M is a semi modular PSU.  650W should be plenty for your 5700xt.  What do you mean when you say extended cables?  It should have come with 2 sets of PCI-E cables to plug in.  You can use both to connect your GPU, but it shouldn't make much difference as the PSU is only a single rail anyways, so feeding with 1 or 2 cables it's still all from a common 12v rail.  I am wondering what you mean by extended cables though, if you use and extension it could be having issues with getting enough power to the GPU through them.  Why couldn't you plug them in directly?  They should be plenty long in most any case.  Are you sure you used the PCI-E connectors and plugged into the correct spot on the PSU?  There is nothing wrong with that PSU for your use, so something else is causing the issues (how it's connected, make sure it's fully seating in PCI-E slot and locked, etc).

It's somewhat less impressive in 2020 than it was in 2015, but this is still a freaking awesome card.  That's a fourteen phase VRM, fitted with Infineon/IR DirectFET 6721s on the high side and 6725s on the low side.  IR's DirectFETs are pretty interesting because the metal surface you see on the outside of them is actually the drain terminal, meaning that while you need to be careful that you don't put a metal heatsink directly on top of them, they're much easier to cool than FETs that have a ceramic or epoxy casing.  Each phase is capable of providing about 50W, meaning you could conceivably provide 700W to the core, as long as you had enough cooling.  For most users, this just means that it should be able to run in the nice friendly part of the efficiency curve, but it also means that you wouldn't be hurting for power with exotic cooling, such as dry ice or liquid nitrogen.



It took some doing to clean the card once I got the heatsink off.  It was shockingly difficult to photograph, but it appears that in its past life, this card had liquid metal applied to it as a TIM, which was apparently not removed very thoroughly before a regular gray aluminum oxide thermal grease was applied on top of it.  I started cleaning it, thinking this was just normal Arctic Silver or something...

But I was surprised when some globs of very shiny, very heavy material appeared from the pool of alcohol and grease residue around the die.

It took forever to get it off - normal solvents don't seem to work, but I finally got the bulk of it.

I admit, I'd never used liquid metal before, although I think I did encounter something like it once on one of my 295X2s.  I assume it must be pretty amazing as a TIM.  Given how much of a pain in the neck it was to clean off the card, I can't imagine anyone would use it if it didn't at least work really well.



Some of the liquid metal appears to have gotten on the thermal pads at some point, which suggests it escaped from the GPU die, and may have gotten into BGA connections under the GPU or memory ICs.

		title=""LM_thermal_pads.jpg"" />





I don't see any under the corresponding memory ICs, but it's possible I cleaned it off, but it damaged the solder balls, or that it's further in there where I can't see it. That might explain our low resistance on the memory power rail, but is purely conjecture at this point.

			How do you mean? It looks like Nvidia's latest drivers are still supporting cards that came out in 2012. Or do you mean they stop optimizing the drivers on specific games for older cards?
		
		Click to expand...
	
The latter.  So for example, you’ll see a more narrow gap in performance between an RTX2060 and a GTX1080Ti on a newer title than you will on an older one. 



Probably the best way to see how this evolves would be to compare the performance of a 780 to an HD7970 in newer titles.  Since AMD’s core architecture still remains more or less the same to this day, owners of that card got significantly more legs from it than the 780 owners, as Kepler’s performance dropped like a stone in newer titles to the point that there was a conspiracy theory floating around that Nvidia was intentionally nerfing it’s performance to incite upgrades.



“Support” was probably a bad choice of words on my part.  “Optimization” would be wiser.  The implication of this is, of course, that you might end up upgrading a GPU sooner than you’d expect to based on software optimizations in newer titles.  For example, if you didn’t care about RTX ray trading and Nvidia kept optimizing the 1080Ti for newer titles, you could probably get a lot more use out of the card than you may otherwise, simply because that card is a beast."

I see you're trying to be snarky but this is bad advice. You're going to have a crap experience trying to play most games using the recommended system requirements."

			Sorry, I made a mistake. The CPU is X3470. The CPU usage in COH never goes above 35% according to Afterburner.

that is still a Core i7 8xx equivalent LGA1156 not the same IPC level unless yeah you can leverage with OC the IPS performance.. still a %35 utilization means nothing if the game is bound to single thread performance



Cpu Bound-> high cpu dependency per core performance but well a i7 8xx shouldn't be as big of a bottleneck as a Core 2 Quad

Cpu limited-> high cpu usage"

Won't I still need a newer Video Card?



I appreciate the advice, maybe I should just try to piece a new system, but I live paycheck to paycheck and it has taken me 6 months to save up $225

No a 2600K is basically a 2500K but with hyperthreading. It's just a drop in replacement for your board.



Yeah I get it man, times are really tough right now. To get the biggest bang I'd drop in a new video card now and start saving for a complete overhaul next year."

			Correct.



AMD is not competitive at the high end. Nvidia has no need to innovate since nobody can touch them. Prices are going up due to lac of competition.



Like you mentioned, this is exactly the same thing that happened to Intel between when they released Sandy Bridge all the way through to when AMD released Ryzen.



Hopefully Intel and AMD can put release high end GPUs this year to compete with Intel.

I don't know how you can say that considering all the new hardware and software tech NVIDIA has brought into the fold in the past 5 years while AMD keeps using the same basic IC design and trying to make it work with the graphics demands of new games.  You would think the underdog would be the one trying to innovate and stand out from the market leader, but it seems like AMD are the ones resting on their laurels perfectly happy with their position in the gaming console and budget- to midtier-PC markets."

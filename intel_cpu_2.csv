Im currently trying to figure out why the intel extreme tuning utility is telling me that my computer is power throttling when its under high loads.



I was doing a Cinebench run and noticed that the utility would show that im power throttling during this test. Originally I had a 650 watt Seasonic power supply and noticed it was both Current throttling and power throttling... ive since upgraded to the Corsair 750 watt sfx power supply which fixed the current throttling but power throttling still remains.



The cpu is not overclocked at all so im not sure why its having this issue. The purpose for this machine is for high performance rendering for VFX. So all id like is to be able to get the full performance out of the hardware that ive invested in. Windows is set to ultimate performance mode but I have not tried to set anything different in the bios yet.



Looking for the best course of action  Thanks!



Edit: nevermind it looks like its still current throttling!!!"

I ran Heaven 4.0 just before the ""upgrade"", and saw a small drop in score. So I was concerned that I might have a ""sidegrade"" on my hands, but that would be rediculous right?



It really depends on the software. Heaven is old code, runs really well on old tech. Deus Ex MD was a completely different story, I was able to go full Ultra settings with the new system, partially due to DX12 I am sure. I hate the idea of Win10, but after a lot of tweking, it's a good experience so far.



I think the slight increase in single thread performance is not really significant enough for me, but the platform I/O is a significant upgrade. I was able to get a 660p in there, and I find that PCIe storage matters, it's a lot faster than SATA, I doubt the old system would handle Win10 as well as this one, and I had no choice but to change, since I want to play some DX12 titles.



Plus, I have yet to OC this thing yet. That will probably reveal the biggest difference, since the 9600K will do ~5.0ghz with ease, where the 2600K maxed out at ~4.6ghz."

Not true. Overclocking is still a thing, but we aren't going up by 800MHz+ anymore. Now its a couple hundred MHz, or as you said making the boost clock the all core value. The 9900KS can be taken to 5.2GHz. 9900K / 9900KF can do 5.0GHz. I've got a 9600K that can do 5.1GHz etc. Ordinarily, the 9900K/KF boosts to 4.9 despite what's advertised. The 5.0GHz number is Turbo Boost Max 3.0 on two cores, but its very specific circumstances that let this happen. I rarely saw it in testing. On Ryzen's you do trade single-threaded performance, but you can pick up allot in multi-threaded workloads by clocking them 100-200MHz higher. Boosting is erratic and won't stay at 4.05GHz all the time or whatever. Locking it down to 4.2GHz or 4.3GHz all core makes a difference."

But wasn't getting a real clear picture if the extra CPU PCIe lanes would help or not.  I was starting to lean back towards the 9900K when I read that the DMI connection between the CPU and chipset is like PCIe x4 and can be saturated by a ""high-end"" NVMe SSD.



Which, now that I'm thinking about it, would I be able to ""assign"" PCIe lanes on the CPU to the NVMe SSDs?  If yes, wouldn't it be worth it to avoid a bottleneck between the CPU and chipset?  If no, then there doesn't seem much point for me to have 48 lanes on the CPU.



As for the AMD processors, I admit to an ancient bias against them when it seemed like there were a lot of compatibility problems with Windows.  I assume that history is long past and I've read some of the comparison reviews and they are impressive.  But switching from a lifelong Intel user to AMD would open up a whole new can of research worms to make me comfortable.  I haven't purchased a motherboard yet so if there are a few links from reliable sources that explain overall advantages/disadvantages to running Windows on Intel/AMD, (not a bunch of benchmarks, but any serious issues), then I would be open to checking them out.

Something to know is that some motherboards simply do not include support for the CPU microcode and will never work. In general, Asrock and Asus will typically work. I'm 50-50 on X99 MSI boards.



There is good info on ServeTheHome's forum https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/es-xeon-discussion.5031/

All the Haswell Xeons are quasi-overclockable. You can use the Haswell Microcode trick to force the higher multipliers to run (sometimes far higher than the regular turbo would allow). It requires changing the wiundows microcode, booting EFI to load custom microcode (or clear the microcode). Some motherboards have custom UEFI written to help the process. It's fairly well documented on Anandtech deep in this thread: https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/what-controls-turbo-core-in-xeons.2496647/





At this point in time, the older gen Xeons ES's get smoked by the Skylake+ Xeons. They just lack the clock rates and IPC and the power draw is huge. Great for budget builds if you simply need more threads than Ryzen provides, or less money than new Xeons.

Anyway, the other night the pump on my H110i failed, causing my system to perform a thermal shutdown when the CPU overheated. I replaced the H110i with a H115i, and since replacing it my idle and load temps are much higher than before...



When I installed the new Corsair H115i, I went into BIOS on my first boot and reset BIOS to stock settings, no OC or anything. Temps were pretty normal on the first boot, around 32c idle, a little higher than the H110i, but I figured it was just cause it had just been installed. Anyway, rather than running any stress tests at that time, I went ahead and restarted, enabled my XMP profile, a modest OC to 4.0ghz. I manually set VCORE to 1.22, and then set all other voltages to stock manually, I don't leave any of my voltages on auto. Upon booting into windows my idle temps were now over 50c, and they have been since then. I've tried reseating the pump head. I've reapplied TIM a few times and can confirm a thin even spread, there is no contact issue. I've gone back to stock clocks. I'm not sure what else I can do to fix this at this point. Running a stress test in OCCT produces a 90c+ temp in less than 3 minutes. Pump speed is set to max, 2080 RPM, fans are running at 1100RPM on the radiator. Liquid temp gradually increases over time under load from 24.5c to about 31-32c, so there is heat transfer happening. Temps are relatively safe when gaming, editing and rendering video, etc... they sit at about 60-63c. CPU Package temp is always a bit higher than Core temps. When idling there is about a 20c difference, my cores idle between 26c-33c, while my Package temp never drops below 50c.



What I am wondering is what could be causing the heat increase? I would assume this newer model h115i would produce better results than the h110i I had on before, but surely that isn't the case. Also the fact that I used to be able to run OCCT for 4 hours with a higher VCORE and never hit 80c, but now I hit over 90c within 3 minutes, is pretty alarming. Sure I can perform daily tasks and game, but I won't be happy until I can figure out what the issue here is... was something damaged because of the thermal shutdown? I have been told more than likely not the case by a few people on reddit/other forums, as that is the point of the TjMAX. Someone suggested that the contact between my IHS and CPU could be poor because of the overheating, but I highly doubt it. The i7 6850k was one of the last Intel CPUs to be soldered, so delidding is pointless, I also don't understand why I'd have to do it, as nothing has changed but the AIO, which I can confirm is working. No sign of blockage or bubbles, no leaks, etc. Is it possible the motherboard or CPU was damaged or is degrading and causing these heating issue? I built the system in Jan 2017, so it's only 3 years old. I have a 1600w EVGA PSU, I have also tested with a 1200w and that didn't change anything, so I know it isnt the PSU.



Has anyone had similar issues with 68XX processor or my motherboard? I received a lot of support on the Corsair forums, but we couldn't come up with an answer. We just came to the conclusion that since the CPU is operating at a reasonable temp when performing my regular work/gaming that I should be happy. Hard for me to be happy with it though as there is obviously something going on. A helpful user suggested I try some other forums, so I figured I'd post here as well as the Intel official forums, I am going to hit the ASUS forums, I have a post on the ROG forum about this, and I am going to look for some more Intel/68XX specific forums.



Any help is greatly appreciated. I've included some images for you guys to check out.

			The point is, processors are getting faster, they are just going about it differently than they did several years ago. I wouldn't dream of going 4c/8t for gaming today, and frankly, there is no need to. While going beyond 8c/16t now doesn't make much sense, this may change in the future. We aren't getting any faster in terms of clock speeds with AMD slipping in clocks from Bulldozer and Intel likely doing the same when they get off 14nm. But today, compared to a 2600K, you end up with clocks that are the same or slightly better on a 9900K, four more cores, eight more threads, more memory bandwidth and a platform with far better I/O and more PCIe lanes.

In reflecting back, it's not only an old platform I'm running, but the gaming SW I'm running is quite old as well - very unlikely using things like the newest AVX instructions.   No doubt the newer processors and platforms have made improvements, but I think the YMMV part of this equation is a lot larger than it used to be.  Going from P3-800 to 1400 T-Bird to 3.0C to Core2Duo to Sandybridge yielded improvements across the board.  I'm pretty well convinced that the stuff I care about will see near zero improvement with the latest offerings from Intel and AMD.



The biggest performance issue I have with my current machine is saturating the 1070TI and having to dial back settings.  I figure I need about a 40% in-game performance boost which means I'm skeptical a 1080TI/2080 could deliver it.   This drives me to consider SLI, as a second 1070TI is definitely within reach for less than $250.  Upside potential is nearly a 100% performance boost, downside potential is it doesn't work and I sell off the extra 1070TI.  2080TI isn't a consideration as I'm not investing a grand in a video card.



IMHO, the latest Intel and AMD releases are overhyped and the result of a market begging for a real upgrade path.  I also agree with the opinion that the demise of sites like [H]ardOCP are likely due to the lack of truly interesting new product coming down the pike at realistic prices.  The IPC/raw speed problem is a tough nut to crack these days.  AMD and Intel has spent at least a decade on it and I know personally that Texas Instruments' DSP business has been gutted by it.

			Funny how AMD flopped for a decade with no viable CPU against Intel and still survive... Now Intel flopped for a year or 2, maybe 4 if they really messed up their ""next gen"" and everybody is telling stories how ""It is the end for Intel"". LOL



I'm glad that AMD finally put some pressure on Intel since we're now getting 8+ cores in the mainstream. However, if AMD become complacent (remember Netburst vs K8 and then Conroe vs Phenom?), intel will crush them again with their (dirty) tactics and money.



And where most of the money is made (enterprise), the decision maker is usually the business guy, not the technical guy. This is simply a case of ""nobody ever got fired for buying Cisco network equipment"" with Intel being Cisco here.

			I have a different philosophy on this. I picked up a 9900K for the added cache. I disable the hyper threading because games are smoother without it. On a 9700K/9900K at 5.1Ghz+ the cores are not the bottleneck, I just wanted more cache for smoothness. I had a 9700K and performance is the same and not noticeable at all.
		
		Click to expand...
	
100% agree with this.  If you have the money to spend, there is ZERO reason to get the 9700k, unless you are planning to upgrade instantly when the 10900k comes out.  And if you were, why would you even buy a 9th gen in the first place?  Save your money and get 10th.

Getting a 9900k and disabling hyperthreading turns it into a super 9700k, as long as you don't get a crappy bin.  Then when you need more than 8 threads, that's when you enable the HT.



Do people have such short memories that they already forgot what happened to the 2500k?  The 2600k remained viable MUCH longer than the 2500k, precisely because of hyperthreading.  Just four years ago there were posts all over the place about people complaining about poor stuttery performance in the latest games on the 2500k while 2600k users in the same game were doing fine.  And keep in mind that the only 6 core processors at that time were HEDT/X series chips and the older extreme versions of the 920 series, etc.



Anyway, why would anyone upgrade to 9th gen *right now*?  The only reason someone would not just wait for 10th gen is because of the Virus stuff upending all schedules.  No telling how long this incident will cause delays in chips and boards being released on the market.  Original estimate was summer but now who knows?  We're in uncharted waters."

I would even offer to buy the board off you if I needed something that robust, but I'm guessing that's in the $300+ range, and I need something for my brother's build who doesn't need fancy features like 2.5G LAN, 3x m.2, or Wifi.

			So, that all aside, I don't have high hopes.  New motherboard/platform, same IPC, 2 more cores and a crap ton more power required.  Sorry you've have so many issues, but you're not likely to gain much by waiting (unless you need more cores for a specific workload).  If you want back to Intel your *likely* to get about the same performance from the current 9900k in most instances (again, unless you have a specific threaded workload).

Agreed -- for gaming specifically, I don't really see the point. If AMD isn't fast enough, then the 9900K is it. Everything after that is a roll of the dice, up to and including having less performance due to variances in configuration at any given level."

I also got the CFL system by that point as well so I was also running Memtest on the new and old RAM as well. Just to disprove the idea that by dumb luck I had 2 4x8 kits that didnt work... obviously it wasnt the case and they came up clean."

That's a darned good score for a five-year-old quad-core CPU.



I will be upgrading to a more modern CPU platform very soon, as some of the programs that I'm currently running now require a 6th-Generation or newer Intel Core series CPU or its AMD performance/feature equivalent in order to run properly.

That was before today's upgrade. I now have an AMD Ryzen 7 3800X and 32 GB of DDR4-3200 RAM (versus the Intel i7-4790K CPU and 32 GB of DDR3-1600 RAM in my previous build).



Here are the results from my 3800X at default clocks:

			IPC is quite a bit further ahead of where it was when your 2600K was new. Sure, older software might not be much faster, but everything else is. With your 1070 Ti, I'd wager a 9900K at 5.0GHz would be a huge step forward.

Which is my point for my use case, I can't go back and add new instructions to my single threaded apps -> I want my platform to run my older software faster as newer software isn't realistically on the table, thus no IPC nor performance bump for me.



This is a big reason YMMV is so significant this time around.  Core2Duo made everything faster, Sandy Bridge made everything faster, no new software required.  This time around the software needs to use the new instructions and/or needs to be multi-threaded to really get a lift.

True, the money isn't what it used to be but you can blame YouTube and the ADD mellenial crowd for that. Still, sites like Anandtech and even TheFPSReview are viable because you can go deeper in an article than you can in a video. It's also easier to consume while you are at work.



HardOCP shut down for different reasons and Kyle has already covered that so I won't get into  that.

I wrote that poorly, I didn't mean to imply that was the only reason for the demise of [H]ardOCP and I'm aware of what happened.  That said, a lot of other sites have disappeared as well.  Perhaps you can blame YouTube and shifting demographics, but I don't think that is the whole story.  I, for one, can't stand video reviews.  For today, Anandtech is decent, but IMHO, it ain't what it used to be.   For the record, I already miss the [H]ardOCP reviews.

10nm was really a double whammy for Intel.  First their was the yield issues that cost them years.  Then came the performance issues that are so bad that it takes a new architecture to balance out what was lost.  They basically lost 5+ years because of the mess.

Again, you shouldn't pay anywhere near $2,000 for a Core i9 10980XE. Intel dropped the MSRP on the 9980XE and 10980XE to right around $1,000 or so. I reviewed the 10980XE here where I covered this in detail. The article was also published the day the Cascade Lake-X CPU's officially launched. That was back on November 25th 2019.

13.5% cpu usage (if it were single threaded it would be <10 like superpi, 100%/16 threads= 6.25% per thread)

15-16% GPU usage

30-31 FPS in fraps using the same setup



Based on what I see on the screen, I think what is happening is that it is trying to continuously, serially decompress textures/objects and that is locked to some kind of cycle in the game loop which limits the performance. Whether it does this on purpose is another thing, it may be that it's locking the frame rate to 30~ FPS on purpose for game mechanic reasons- Eg physics



It is highly possible that the draw distance or some other feature is limiting it also..



I don’t believe that this is actually cpu limited, at least no more than I believe UT3 was at release where it had a leak which pegged as many threads as it could at 100% but most of that was engine waiting on things to happen, this was fixed by later versions.



Based on my many years of game/programming knowledge, I truly believe the issue here is bad coding and/or lack of optimisation due to locking code - not lack of cpu power.



If, in the extremely unlikely event I am incorrect, it is possible that a Ryzen chip of decent clock (say 4.4-4.6ghz single thread) would beat out the intel equivalent for this, being that they do have more execution pipelines/resources per core, and therefore potentially fewer opportunities to stall. This does rely on what the compiler did when it compiled the program though.

It’s a work computer and so could it be that the image that was used for the hard drive is bad?  But I can’t imagine windows on boot does not detect a HT capable cpu and adjust appropriately.

			You should be fine.  There are no current games that play below 50fps on a 4790k; most of them still play around 100 fps.  You will usually be limited by by  your video card (especially if you play with RTX on at native res).



But I'm not sure you will ever run into this problem -  7nm EUV is a cutting-edge process node, so they may delay introduction of the Ti version.  You will porobably have to wait until next spring for that release, and by that time you will have Zen 3.



I see no reason you can't run the LG on HDMI 2.0  4:2:0 at 120 hz for games, and 60hz 8-bit for browsing the internet/video.  I ran my LG C7 on my old HTPC's GTX 750  Ti at 4:2:0 60hz (older games at 1080p high, newer games at 720p high), until I could upgrade my GTX 960 in my main rig and make use of that (it plays older games just fine at 4k 60, and newer RPG games at 1080p med/high).



But with only the GTX 1080 Ti, you will be more GPU-limited at 4k.

			I don't think a single 480 rad loop will run $1K, but you have a 7980XE that costs quite a bit, an Apex board that ain't cheap, 64GB of RAM that's not inexpensive, etc. In contrast, my 7980XE rig has HW Labs GTX 480, GTX 420, GTX 240 x 2, all in P/P, 2 pumps, a single reservoir, hard lines, etc. I probably have a bit more than $1K in that loop, but there's a lot more gear than a single 480 involved.



But the main point was that with either an OCd 7980XE or 10980XE, a NH-U12A is going to be less than sufficient. I ran a NH D14 on mine to get it all dialed in before going under water and but didn't really try to OC it with that on, and it's a more capable cooler than the U12. I also didn't realize that these CPUs draw 600+ watts when I built it (that's with a decent OC and doing some intense work), that's a lot of heat to dissipate.

			Ok rather than speculate and use superpi, I have a system as per my signature (4k monitor, 1080ti, 9900k). I am prepared to buy TS12 and benchmark it if you would like a comparison point. Just tell me what settings and what I need to do, and I will run it.



I'm downloading it now. Note there is a 2019 ""version"" which may be the simple rail to performance if it has the same features.



Also, I am not making mistakes re superpi:

You are comparing results that you said scaled with superpi back in the 00s, for something that was released in 2012, that uses graphics (therefore graphics loop), that has variable load, and is by your admission multithreaded but you insist on single threaded pi.



It’s like comparing an apple with a plum because it is spherical.

Hmm, interesting as I'd be really curious how TS12 would run on a 9900K and 1080TI.  I don't do Steam, but I'd be willing to for the $2.50 to buy TS12 and then we would be running the exact same version of TS12.  I could then setup a save game file for you and we could run some fraps benchmarks that I have found to be very repeatable.  So if you are willing, I'm willing.  I think the results would be very interesting both from the CPU and GPU perspective.  Let me know ASAP and I'll put the test files together.





Just make sure you are looking at the right version.  This is TS12 I'm referring to:



http://www.trainzportal.com/product/view/trainz_simulator_12



On steam its only $2.50 for the next 17 hours: 

TS12 is Trainz Simulator 12.  The other versions are Trainz a New Era (TANE) and TRS19.  I'm not interested in TRS19.  TANE would be difficult to compare as I run jailbreaked DLC content on it that I don't feel comfortable sharing.   I had to jailbreak the content because NV3 broke it in TANE - long story and one of the reasons for disinterest in TRS19.



Intesting benchmarks for TS12:

1) With low video settings, CPU limited framerate is very apparent, this would remove differences between our video cards.

2) A high video settings it would be interesting to me to see the difference between the 1070TI and 1080TI.  If the performance increase is more than expected due to core count/memory bandwidth/published benches then one could assume that is due to improved CPU instructions helping the Nvidia driver.



There is a piece here that you are not understanding in my previous replies: I'm actually talking about two very different versions of the same game:



TS12 is old code, going back to 1998 or so.  It is single threaded.  Some slight improvements have been made, but they are minor.  Trainz customers have been complaining about this for a very long time and the underlying code base of TS12 is 21 years old. CPU limited performance of this version is closely tracked by SuperPI differences.  When I'm referring to SuperPI and performance, I'm referring to this version only and it is very much apples to apples.



In TS12, one can turn on an extreme amount of anti-aliasing and get really good video quality, albeit in DX9.  TS12 only does DX9.



IMO, the most important thing is for the game to run smoothly - 100's of tons don't roll by jittering.  Thus, VSYNC or frame rate limiting is done to cap the frame rate.  50 FPS is sufficient - this is not a first person shooter.  Triple buffering is also used.  TS12 will run smooth at a given frame rate with the CPU at nearly 90% and the video card at 95% at the same time as the video card is rendering what the CPU came up with during the previous frame.  It is very easy to tell just what is maxing out when the frame rate dips.  TANE is a totally different animal.



TANE truly is a new era as the engine code was rewritten and is now 64 bit.  It has its own issues, but I've found it is a pretty good simulator base to run TS12 assets (long story).  TANE is multi-threaded, and thus, SuperPI does not relate to it at all.  TANE's primary issue with me is that it is only DX11 and has fairly poor anti-aliasing that appears to use a lot of GPU horsepower.  It appears to run well on my 4c/8t 2600K and has never appeared to be CPU bound.  I'd be very happy with it if the anti-aliasing worked as good as TS12 under DX9.



I've always had two questions about these simulators:



1) Is there a CPU powerful enough to run TS12 at 50FPS, and if so, how much video card is required to run at high image quality settings?



2) How much video card is required to run TANE at 4K with high video settings to maintain 50 FPS?



I doubt there is an existing CPU that can satisfy 1) today or in the near future.  I think 2 may be satisfied by a 2080TI or maybe SLI'ed 1070TIs if SLI can be made to work in TANE.



I hope I've clarified this and let me know.  I think the results could be very interesting - just how much does the newest CPU arch help on old games?  I'm thinking not a lot, but I would love to be proven wrong.

			If you want more IPC , just wait for Zen 3.  All Intel is doing is adding more cores.



There might be a 100-200 mhz core bump as well (so total 15-20% over zen 2)?



Show me a game where the 9900ks is more than 10% faster than a  3950x w tuned ram..  Zen 3 is supposed to COMPLETELY REVERSE that gap!

			Reading may be fundamental, and I do read, but I cannot accept that software for calculating pi is analogous to single thread performance in a game, regardless of what said game is.



Your assertions beg the following questions: what performance increase are you trying to achieve and why?



Certainly some games will benefit from storage/IO improvements, certainly some single thread software is storage bound. Without knowing what these games are, we can’t advise- so what are they?



It really sounds to me like you are trying to justify spend on a new processor, but if things are “fast enough” you really don’t need to.
		
		Click to expand...
	
I'm actually going the other way .  I don't think the spend on a cpu is worth it at this time.  I also wasn't really asking for game advice.  I didn't want to clutter the thread with game titles that are not likely of interest here, but here it goes:



My monitor is a Samsung 40"" 4K TV.



Auran/NV3 Games Trainz TS12 and Trainz and New Era.  Both of these games are real train/model train simulators that have a very small market and certainly are never part of review site's selection of games for benchmarking.  Years ago I found SuperPI is very good for predicting TS12 performance when CPU bound and it was a common benchmark seen in reviews.  I have yet to find a common benchmark for the video card, but Heaven tracks video bound performance decently, but not as good as SuperPI tracks CPU.



TS12 is extremely CPU bound running code that isn't all that much different than the first version in 1999.  Never been able to run it over 30 FPS smoothly.  30 FPS is okay for this but not great.  To be smooth, it cannot drop below 30 FPS - it is just the way the game engine works.  It can run into limits both in video and CPU.  An X% improvement in 32M Super Pi pretty much means an X% improvement in TS12 if it is CPU limited.  Thus, if TS12 is capping at 25 FPS and 100% CPU,  a 20% improvement in SPI score will get it up to 30 FPS.  I've been playing this single threaded SPI/Trainz thing for a very long time going back to the P4 and previous versions of the game.



Ironically, that 30 FPS limitation helped the video card because I like lots of antialiasing.  When TANE came around, NV3 Game actually made some serious improvements in the CPU side of things, and running TS12 assets in TANE is no longer CPU limited.  TANE will hold a constant 60 FPS and might intermittently load one core to 70% at times, while the others bobble around 35%, and most of the time the primary thread is at about 48% load with the 2600K running at 4.9 GHz.  Game is clearly not limited by the 2600K.



That flips me back to the video card, because now I run the game at 50 FPS and there are places on the map the 1070TI cannot keep up.  It also raises another problem, the antialiasing on TANE in DX11 is horrid compared to DX9.  Also note that all those nice forced antialiasing modes in Nvidia Inspector don't work in DX11.  The game content is still quite dated, so DX11 doesn't look all that better.   TANE is quite capable at maxing out the 1070TI at 4K.  If I don't run it at 4K, the image quality is terrible which I suspect is from DX11, as TS12 in DX9 looks great at 1080P.



Makes me wish I could get enough CPU to run TS12 at 50 FPS and that would require about 125% improvement in IPC.  For those old enough, a doubling of performance (100%) used to happen in a few years, so waiting for 125% more didn't used to be such a big deal.



NV3 Games has gotten into the DLC/DRM in a big way while are extremely slow to address fundamental issues, so my spend with them is done as I don't expect much from them to improve DX11 antialiasing.  So it's either TANE or TS12 with enough CPU.



Aside from Trainz, I'd also like to see FSX run like FS9 does today.  While P3D represents further development past FSX, FSX has some features the P3D does not.  FSX was designed single threaded and I believe they targeted a 10GHz CPU.



So there's the why.  What I was really hoping for was somebody to pipe up that the Meltdown and Spectre fixes were holding back SuperPI scores.  It looks like my next spend will be in the video card department.



As for current games, I've got a backlog of now old games to still try and life gets in the way of the rest.

			I know, they actually go hand in hand. Gotta have good cooling, gotta have VRM cooling. And yes, you're right, it's power limiters in the BIOS that are causing it to throttle.



I personally don't have AVX disabled in the BIOS. I don't even think mine has the option to disable it.

VRM overheating i will also induce a thermal throttle and not a current throttle. So its not really hand in hand.



The AVX question was for the OP. Im thinking when it current throttles is when its under AVX workload as Cinebench does use AVX.



Under non AVX 100% load my 10 core at 4.6GHz pulls about 175w. Under AVX workload with a -3 on the multi it pulls 400w at the CPU."

			Sadly, that's not always the answer. According to the OP's signature, it would be. However, all things being equal a faster CPU will equal better performance. When overclocked sufficiently the 10980XE does fairly well on the gaming front. That said, I agree with you and that a better GPU would be more beneficial here. It's also worth noting that the Core i9 10980XE costs RTX 2080 Ti money. That would be the most bang for your buck upgrade in this scenario. Its considerably faster than a 1070 Ti and will provide a bigger upgrade to performance than any CPU upgrade on the market would.



Of course, this late in the RTX 2080 Ti's life cycle I'd hold off on a major GPU purchase.

If you don't have the time to properly research to give accurate advice, don't give any advice at all. If you had looked them up, they had been long been patched and requires physical access to even exploit these. This was an article from the old Zen 1 architecture. This was a whole sham by Viceroy research to defame AMD.





To the OP - 9900k gets my recommendation and also the 3700x or 3900x from AMD.  You can be confident that AMD now (currently that is) the superior platform with X570 with more available PCI-E bandwidth as well. If you don't feel comfortable, totally understand but I would do a little research on these CPUs and how they perform in more recent benchmarks. As of Zen 2, AMD is no longer considered a budget alternative especially if its not chasing the highest FPS for games."

Which, now that I'm thinking about it, would I be able to ""assign"" PCIe lanes on the CPU to the NVMe SSDs?  If yes, wouldn't it be worth it to avoid a bottleneck between the CPU and chipset?  If no, then there doesn't seem much point for me to have 48 lanes on the CPU.



As for the AMD processors, I admit to an ancient bias against them when it seemed like there were a lot of compatibility problems with Windows.  I assume that history is long past and I've read some of the comparison reviews and they are impressive.  But switching from a lifelong Intel user to AMD would open up a whole new can of research worms to make me comfortable.  I haven't purchased a motherboard yet so if there are a few links from reliable sources that explain overall advantages/disadvantages to running Windows on Intel/AMD, (not a bunch of benchmarks, but any serious issues), then I would be open to checking them out.



Thanx,

You can get a 12 core AMD 3900x for the same or less than a 9900k. And it has native PCI-E 4 support. Or you can save some cash and get AMD's 8 core 3700X and still have that PCI-E support. Also, waaaaaaay less vulnerabilities to patch on AMD processors."

Luck?  No, Intel sat on their ass and created what we call a window of opportunity.  Intel spent about the same amount on R&D last year as stock buy backs.   Billions that could have been used for doubling the R&D budget.  For a company that has fallen behind, they sure don't act like it."

Sorry to necro this thread but I too have a 3939k I’m at 4.2 (summer) and have a question if you have a minute.  



Currently rocking a 3930k and a 980ti and want an upgrade.  My monitor is a Acer 1440p 144-165 Gsync.   Do you have any experience at this resolution and speeds (120 is fine I’d like to see what faster looks like though) with the 3930k and the 2080 TI.  



I’m not sure if I should do the 2080ti with this system or drop it to a 2080 and do a new board, new cpu, ram, and eventually take advantage of the on board ssd.   To get my best bang for the buck.  I feel like just a 2080 or even a 1080ti might even get that 120hrz fine but I’m also super concerned with frame time with that type of set up.  Stutter is a big concern for me.



Sorry for the long post and appreciate any opinions on the subject,  and I didn’t mean to necro or hijack just thought this would be a better place to ask then start a new post.

I'm considering the i9-10900X for the additional PCIe lanes.  I haven't been able to determine if the extra lanes would be helpful for me so I'm hoping for some feedback based on the following details of my planned build and usage.



- I'm not a hard core gamer.  At most I'll play something like WoW

- I'm a photographer and use the latest versions of Lightroom and Photoshop

- At this time, no other intensive programs

- Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 graphics card

- Two M.2 NVMe Samsung 970 PRO 512 GB SSDs (one as Win 10 boot drive, one as program drive)

- Two 120GB SATA SSDs (one for Windows paging file, one for Photoshop scratch disk)

- Two 480GB SATA SSDs (quick access for things like Lightroom catalog and previews, and raw cache, and whatever)

- Additional large SATA HDDs for data and photos



So, would the  extra PCIe lanes be beneficial with this setup, or am I just naively barking up a shiny tree?

Thank you for your response, 

So the AVX offset that I am currently on is 0. I had it at -3 but the cpu was not hitting 5GHZ. In fact, it was a little bit lower than the factory turbo speed. If I were to get a 360mm cooler which cooler do you think is optimal for quiet but cool performance?

To respond in a similar light, the issue with adding cache --> winning is that that's a one-time deal. AMD cannot add more cache and get more performance, and Zen 2 looks like 'peak Zen'. Now they have to go back to the drawing board and actually innovate for more IPC, like Intel has already done with Ice Lake.

You mean; How do I know Super Pi doesn't translate to game performance? Because it doesn't. There is a big difference between what's done in a game engine and calculating Pi over and over again. Also, experience tells me that modern processors are faster than older ones even if Super Pi doesn't really showcase this. There are plenty of other benchmarks and applications that do.



For example, cache sizes and cache design greatly impact game performance. This is literally how AMD raised the performance of its Ryzen 3000 series to be much more in line with Intel's gaming performance than its 2000 series was. AMD even calls the increased L3 cache; ""Gamecache.""

Changes in that benchmark and changes in Super Pi are coincidental. I'd be willing to bet they do not correlate into anything useful. Meaning, you can't use Super Pi as an indicator for how many FPS your going to get under xyz circumstance. It's the same for something far more sophisticated like 3D Mark, which is actually designed for that purpose. The variables that impact it do not necessarily translate to games. You can't say I get 8056 3D Marks, so I can get 120FPS in CoD:MW 2019. It simply doesn't work that way. Again, calculating Pi isn't the same as running a game engine. That goes for any engine.

For Super Pi? Yeah, I'd think so. Clock speed is going to matter here more than anything and the architectural changes made since Sandy Bridge are probably not going to have much of an impact here. Calculating Pi is a pretty simple task. It's hard on the CPU in a sense, but it doesn't utilize that much of it. Again, this is why you can't look at Super Pi results as an indicator of game performance. You are comparing Apples and 1973 Mustang II's. There is nothing meaningful in the comparison.

I brought up the other things because those other things you aren't interested in can and do directly impact game performance. Again, Super Pi doesn't make sense as an indicator of game performance. You are putting way too much stock in it.  Again, your misinformed in thinking that Super Pi in anyway shape or form has any bearing on how different CPU's behave in games. My Super Pi times are similar on my 10980XE and the 9900K. However, the latter is far better at actually playing games.

What I said wasn't an ""Intel sales pitch."" First off, I wouldn't recommend an Intel processor in most cases right now.

I've literally been reviewing and working with this hardware for more than two decades. I've had all of these generations of CPU's on my test bench and I can tell you that the benchmarks show case the differences and how far we've come. Sure, its not the same as taking a Pentium III at 233MHz and comparing it to one at 1GHz, but there has been major advancements since Sandy Bridge. Many of those advances will impact your gaming experience.



It seems I'm the one who hit the raw nerve.

			Patience grasshopper, that is only a starting point.  I have been tuning this game for a very long time, what works is tuning the CPU w/o GPU limits, cranking up the resolution and anti-aliasing, then tweaking a thing here and there.   The most difficult part is finding the parts of the game that really load up either the CPU or GPU as it can max out both at different times.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Tuning every game is pretty much the same. You find out what settings have the most impact on performance and decide what trade offs to make regarding performance vs. visual fidelity. As for the hardware side, its not that complicated. You get your CPU, RAM and GPU running as fast as possible while being stable. The only part of the equation that's difficult to manage sometimes are the game settings themselves. Certain shadow options or other features may impact one engine more than another in terms of performance, but due to implementation, may or may not impact visuals very much.

The data is what it is. I'm curious to see what his findings are. Either way, I'm still fairly certain that Super Pi can't be used as a meaningful benchmark for determining game performance. This is where you've seriously gone wrong here. Even if the 9900K isn't much faster with this game than your 2600K, it still wouldn't prove that Super Pi is a good metric to go by. Again, the Super Pi benchmark results are virtually the same between my 10980XE and the 9900K. Yet, for gaming, the latter is considerably better in most cases. While average frame rates may report the same, getting into the lows, maximums and frame times, you'll see that the 10980XE is in some cases, vastly inferior to the 9900K. In other words, if all I get out of you two is an average frame rate for each system, I won't be convinced because that by itself is virtually meaningless.



i actually test performance for a living and I don't limit my scope to a single ancient game or ancient hardware. I don't judge hardware's viability for gaming by a benchmark that has nothing to do with gaming that wasn't designed as a metric for gaming performance in the first place."

Don't buy a 120GB SSD OP, and especially not for a Photoshop or page file disk. If anything do what they said and grab 1-2 large NVME drive(s) and maybe another 1TB or 2TB SATA SSD if you want additional storage. You don't need to run Windows by itself on an NVME drive as performance is more than fast enough to do whatever on the drive in addition to the OS.

			Cascade Lake-X launched some time ago. Although, few of the CPU's have actually been available for purchase. Here is the deal: If you have a delidded 7980XE that can do 4.5GHz, it probably isn't worth the upgrade. You'll be spending a lot of money to maybe reach 4.7 or 4.8GHz. That's about all these are good for given how hot they get. Delidding won't do as much for these either as they have a soldered TIM. The CPU itself is essentially the same except for supporting additional RAM and having a 48 PCIe lanes instead of 44.



Also, the Core i9 10980XE CPU's should cost about $1,100. Any more than $1,200 and you are blatantly getting ripped off.

			Fanboy at work again. You can't really think Ryzen is all that much better than Skylake refreshes. Clock for clock they are within error most of the time. AMD just caught up to a five year old architecture. I am glad they did, but Ryzen is not an Intel beater without the massive cache and core count, thus is still situatioinal advantagious. Ice Lake is showing massive IPC advantages over current tech, but it's vaporware ATM.

			Ryzen is certainly a better value, in multithread for sure, but you are dodging the point. AMD just caught up, they are not beating Intel in performance architecture, yet. I am not a Intel fanboy at all, as I have said. I also hope AMD continues to improve the core architecture, not just adding cores. I hope they pull another Athlon 64 innovation on Intel, and force the end of stagnation of CPU design we have suffered. I am just not a delusional AMD fanbot either.
		
		Click to expand...
	
They have just pulled an a64, beaten Intel everywhere except a few games and using significantly (or many times) less power. And at lower clocks, thus AMD IPC is higher than Intel. Only thing keeping them relevant is clocking 14nm to the limit.



I guess we have not seen the same benchmarks?

I had multiple a64/opteron rigs and they were much the same. Few games and certain video editing niches Intel were competitive in.

This is no different.



Ice lake IPC is going to be a little higher but the clocks also lower on 10nm. Certianly not going to see the fabled 20-30% claims. Only time you will see that is comparing unmitigated cpus to next gen.



AMD however has a newly established reputation of making very accurate IPC claims. Intel marketing currently has almost zero trustworthiness."

Motherboard is ASUS X79 Pro and I won't be chaniging anything but CPU.

I have never done this before and am trying to understand what is involved.

Is it as simple as physically swapping the CPUs and then boot up and the BIOS recognizes it?

Or will I need to go to setup screen and configure things?

Will Win 7 Pro automatically recognize it?

This is with a few personal caveats:



1) I generally don't play modern games, and only one that I do play that is multicore won't max out a 4c/8t CPU.

2) Games I do play tend to be simulations and are single thread heavy.

     - in my experience, the 32M SuperPI bench below tracks differences quite nicely.

3) Generally don't do multicore stuff.



So, on multicore stuff, definite improvement in performance and cost since the lowly 2600K circa 2011.  However, on single core, there really doesn't seem to be much improvement at all.  I've got a 2600K on an Asus Maximus IV Extreme with 16GB of Samsung low latency DDR-1600 memory that can do 2133.  I looked around for some SuperPI32 benchmarks on the web and benchmarked my machine as well as my Dell 8700 at work:

1866 Low Latency is 9-9-9-27

2133 Auto I believe is 11-11-11-33, I just left the setting on auto

2600K air cooled with some Thermalright TRUE, variable vcore max 1.4V (1.437V to hit 5.1G).

Video card is 1070TI even though that really doesn't matter here.



My 2600K is just a game machine running Win7, so I'm not running any of the Spectre or Meltdown ""fixes"" and perhaps this is why the results above show an 8 year old system beating modern HW on a single threaded benchmark.  I also don't see AMD beating Intel just yet.



If I ever get hooked on some demanding multi-core game perhaps my attitude will change, but with an upgrade at this point requiring motherboard, memory, and CPU the bank for the buck just isn't there and the wallet stays closed.  To me, the CPU market feels very much like when Intel was recalling 1.1G P3s and the year or so before AMD launched the 1.4G T-Bird.



Feel free to pick at the thinking behind this as I'm curious what others think.  At this point, I have no reason to care about multithread beyond 4 cores, so not so curious about 4+ cores at this time.

			These prices are VERY aggressive.  Focusing on just HEDT parts, I think the 10940x will give AMD the stiffest competition.  Since the 16 core desktop is $750, it's safe to say the TR 16 core will be close to the $784 price of the Intel cpu.  With the right clocks, it could match AMD in MT and most likely beat it in gaming.

AFAIK, isn't 3rd gen TR starting at 24 cores? That being said, maybe it starts at a higher price bracket than 2nd gen, since AM4 is getting a 16core part. Either way, interesting market to be in"

Anything that really pushes the chip, especially with AVX, will pretty much always cause power/current throttling. It has nothing to do with your PSU being inadequate, it's just that the cihp is trying to pull more power than what the factory limits are set to for your motherboard. That's the reality for pretty much every Intel CPU above midrange (6+ cores w/hyperthreading).

			Thanks for the thoughtful and interesting replies.  In reflecting back, it's not only an old platform I'm running, but the gaming SW I'm running is quite old as well - very unlikely using things like the newest AVX instructions.   No doubt the newer processors and platforms have made improvements, but I think the YMMV part of this equation is a lot larger than it used to be.  Going from P3-800 to 1400 T-Bird to 3.0C to Core2Duo to Sandybridge yielded improvements across the board.  I'm pretty well convinced that the stuff I care about will see near zero improvement with the latest offerings from Intel and AMD.



The biggest performance issue I have with my current machine is saturating the 1070TI and having to dial back settings.  I figure I need about a 40% in-game performance boost which means I'm skeptical a 1080TI/2080 could deliver it.   This drives me to consider SLI, as a second 1070TI is definitely within reach for less than $250.  Upside potential is nearly a 100% performance boost, downside potential is it doesn't work and I sell off the extra 1070TI.  2080TI isn't a consideration as I'm not investing a grand in a video card.



IMHO, the latest Intel and AMD releases are overhyped and the result of a market begging for a real upgrade path.  I also agree with the opinion that the demise of sites like [H]ardOCP are likely due to the lack of truly interesting new product coming down the pike at realistic prices.  The IPC/raw speed problem is a tough nut to crack these days.  AMD and Intel has spent at least a decade on it and I know personally that Texas Instruments' DSP business has been gutted by it.

IPC is quite a bit further ahead of where it was when your 2600K was new. Sure, older software might not be much faster, but everything else is. With your 1070 Ti, I'd wager a 9900K at 5.0GHz would be a huge step forward. 



As for sites like HardOCP dying off, it has nothing to do with not having interesting product. We never had a shortage of articles to do. True, the money isn't what it used to be but you can blame YouTube and the ADD mellenial crowd for that. Still, sites like Anandtech and even TheFPSReview are viable because you can go deeper in an article than you can in a video. It's also easier to consume while you are at work.



HardOCP shut down for different reasons and Kyle has already covered that so I won't get into  that."

Another Skylake version with 2 more cores on a new socket LGA 1200. Seems like the speed is a little under what was expected so this is new bad news.

Fact is nobody may expect for LGA1200 to live longer than AM4, and eventually will have a shorter life since AM4 is expected to support Zen 3 in 2020 and 2021. 10 core will need 140 TDP support on the motherboard.

In fact the launch of Comet Lake for Desktop looks like as awkward as Skylake X HEDT. Hope they drop their price since one still won't have ECC RAM would need to go for 490 chipset for Raid feature. All this is offered by AMD on all their CPU line (and APU from the Pro line). Not a big deal for Intel to put those features ON on all their products. Intel is so unattractive.

You can read more about this here. 



Essentially, the difference between an AMD based system and an Intel based system isn't the type of thing you would ever notice if you were to work on one system, get up and do something else and then sit back down to the competing platform. You probably wouldn't even notice the difference if you used the systems for different things. However, when the two are side by side using nearly identical configurations doing the exact same workloads or tests, you can see it. At least, I could when I was testing the 3900X and benchmarking it against the 9900K. The monitors and other hardware were the same across both test systems and I felt the difference.

Sadly, that's not always the answer. According to the OP's signature, it would be. However, all things being equal a faster CPU will equal better performance. When overclocked sufficiently the 10980XE does fairly well on the gaming front. That said, I agree with you and that a better GPU would be more beneficial here. It's also worth noting that the Core i9 10980XE costs RTX 2080 Ti money. That would be the most bang for your buck upgrade in this scenario. Its considerably faster than a 1070 Ti and will provide a bigger upgrade to performance than any CPU upgrade on the market would.

It sure can for TS12.  In TANE I'm not seeing the CPU limiting performance, steady 50 FPS is all I want.  However, I'd really, really like to run TS12 at 50FPS, but that isn't likely to happen at all until one of these processor companies actually improves IPC without resorting to new instructions.



Don't make the mistake of discounting the results of SuperPi simply because you don't like what it is telling you.  Improvement in SuperPI scores has flatlined, that doesn't make them irrelevant due to all the existing SW.  I've actually got 1M SPI scores going back to Tulatin P3 that I grabbed when convenient. 



This is how IPC used to change with generations uses the venerable E8400 as a reference:

The 2600K is only 28.5% faster than the E8400, but the E8400 is a whopping 236.3% faster than the P4 Prescott.  All of those scores are at reasonable max overclocks for those processors.

But even that statement is a drastic oversimplification.



Intel is entrenched in OEM and Server markets and both of those groups are slow at best to change.

On the enthusiast end, it's possible or even likely that AMD will continue to take 90% of purchases.  But that's an infinitesimally small part of the pie in comparison to OEM and Server.



Intel just has to weather the storm.  They will have the worse part for a few years.  It's not like this has never been the case before.  I've lived through P4 Netburst architecture.  Even ""if"" it takes until 2025, they have plenty of cash and can continue funding themselves for years to come.  And it's also not like they'll be making zero money just because they aren't dominant.  It just means ""less"" income.  Similar to what AMD has been doing all these years.

Making ""less"" won't immediately doom them and thinking it will is ignoring more or less every competitive market that exists and instead just spreading FUD and doom and gloom.

			To respond in a similar light, the issue with adding cache --> winning is that that's a one-time deal. AMD cannot add more cache and get more performance, and Zen 2 looks like 'peak Zen'. Now they have to go back to the drawing board and actually innovate for more IPC, like Intel has already done with Ice Lake.



On the one hand, kudos to AMD for being ready for an opening from Intel, and on the other, AMD has to continue to execute with Nvidia-like precision if they're going to keep pace with Intel.

Current info says that Zen 3 will offer a 17% increased IPC gain over Zen 2, which was already a 13% IPC gain from Zen.

https://www.thefpsreview.com/2019/1...l-reportedly-offer-an-average-ipc-gain-of-17/

I would also argue that Intel hasn't been pushing or innovating for roughly 7 years.  Their track record is right there.  This has been the subject of conversation for sometime.  It hasn't been worth it for basically any quad core i7 owner since 3000 series CPU's to upgrade until Hex and Quad core's came out.  Which only came out due to AMD pushing them to and only offered gains due to core count not increased IPC per core.



Still, to Intel's ""credit"" if you want to call it that, they were so dominant 10 years ago they didn't need to really compete all this time as they haven't had anyone to compete with.  It took basically 10 years of Intel doing nothing to find the crack for AMD to get the wedge in.  But now that the wedge is in, it's ignorant to flatly deny that it's happening.



AMD has been calling their shots for the past 3 years.  They said that things were coming and then they delivered them.  I have no reason to believe that Zen 3 will not arrive on time.  And although 17% increased IPC is currently not confirmed by third parties, what can be said with certainty is that they will be faster than current Zen 2 parts.  If Intel continues to sit as they have, it is likely that Zen 3 will finally eclipse all the last bastions that Intel has held onto, such as gaming."

Since the temps for an i9 are like that I will most likely change the fans and keep the cooler.

You likely need to turn off/disable speed stepping, it clocks the cpu down when not in heavy use to save power and heat, turning it off the cpu runs the CPU at 100% boost (or OC) all the time.

Thats probably why you're not seeing the 5.0ghz, its also why your processor probably isnt overheating/temp throttling, as noted you need to fix that idle temp problem first."

I picked this model because I have a pile of 16 GB DDR4 ECC RDIMMs that I know are compatible with the tower.  I tested them in a tower I have in the office. I bought a Xeon E5-2640v3 CPU.  I populated the first two of eight memory slots, booted up, saw 32 GB.  Powered down, populated all slots, and got an error.  Amber blink code 2,7 which refers to a memory power error.  The manual suggests the usual, remove all sticks but two, power on, add them back, etc to find out what sticks are bad.   To make a long store short, I can boot fine with the first 4 memory slots fill, seeing 64 GB of memory.  I can't boot once I go beyond the first four slots.  I've rotated and swapped out the memory several times over, and I can always reproduce the error if I go beyond the first 4 slots.



So, that being said, Intel site lists the processor supporting 4 memory channels.  Does this equate to memory slots?  As in, if I wanted to populate all 8 slots, I'd need a higher end processor?  I didn't think so, but I'm stuck on the fact I can't fill more than 4 slots.  The system BIOS is up to date.  I thought about trying to reset the CMOS and trying again, but wanted to check here first.  I have little experience building systems using Xeon processors and anything more than 4 memory slots."

This is strictly power throttling and that can be one of two things. VRM temp or in this case something built into the BIOS to throttle back to prevent overloading of the severely inferior power delivery.

Leaving out the PI write and the end makes the BM more repeatable because it removes the uncertainty of the disk access.  Nothing wrong with comparing one machine's loop 24 to another's.



Is it really that hard for you to believe that one game engine could see the same performance deltas between CPU clock speeds and X86 architectures when one program is that game engine while CPU limited and the other a benchmark of CPU throughput?  Especially for a game you're very likely not familiar with?  Really???  Can't *ever* happen?!??!



Think about it...everything a computer does is a computation.  I never suggested extending SPI results past this single game when it is being CPU limited.

I think intel should be more worried about these large companies like Apple, MS, Google and Amazon producing their own ARM based server cpus than competition from AMD. The neoverse cpus have promising performance and Apple is especially good with ARM. That could be billions lost in revenue if eventually those companies decide to use their in house cpus exclusively.

The only reason I upgraded at all was because I was having an occasional freezing issue with my 5820k system that I tried for over a year to solve and I finally threw in the towel.  I never actually identified what the issue was, but it got to the point where during the course of my diagnostics, I had swapped out every single component other than my CPU and Motherboard, and even at stock settings (no overclock, etc) it would still freeze.  Sometimes it would go a week or more without freezing, sometimes it would freeze several times per day.  Never a BSOD, the system would simply freeze.

The 5820k now lives on in my backup system, where I'm not as concerned about the possibility of it freezing since it doesn't get used very often, and the large number of PCIE lanes let me resurrect my 3 old GTX680 cards for Triple-SLI (most of the games I care about still support SLI)."

Also, super pi isn't totally indicative of IPC

TANE isn't worth the trouble.



In my experience, memory speed and latency impact SPI scores.  Low latency memory equivalent to about another 100MHz in clock speed:

Getting into the 6:20's is a good 5% improvement in the benchmark.

			I don't put much weight in AVX - and that's coming as a Haswell user who is *very* cognizant of the unprecedented thermal loads that AVX creates.

Based on the OP's typical workloads (simulation, ST-heavy), I don't believe AVX or Ryzen's strengths are at all applicable to him.



That said, while IPC has basically stagnated post-CFL, I think the combination of both high clocks (5GHz) and the IPC bump on current Intel platform could present some value. I wouldn't buy new, but used. But even then, there's no rush to upgrade either. I'm only on 4/4, and NGL, that Ryzen 3000-series roll out was disappointing. Maybe Ryzen refresh (Zen 3, 4000-series) gives Ryzen the clock headroom for the undisputed lead for good.



And Keljian is right - there is still a big benefit to staying on a modern platform.

The lead AMD establishes will never be something we can consider to be permanent. Intel simply has too much money and too many resources to allow this to go on indefinitely. Although, Ryzen 3000 was anything but disappointing. Other than those points, I generally agree with you. 



The point is, processors are getting faster, they are just going about it differently than they did several years ago. I wouldn't dream of going 4c/8t for gaming today, and frankly, there is no need to. While going beyond 8c/16t now doesn't make much sense, this may change in the future. We aren't getting any faster in terms of clock speeds with AMD slipping in clocks from Bulldozer and Intel likely doing the same when they get off 14nm. But today, compared to a 2600K, you end up with clocks that are the same or slightly better on a 9900K, four more cores, eight more threads, more memory bandwidth and a platform with far better I/O and more PCIe lanes."

			I'm actually going the other way .  I don't think the spend on a cpu is worth it at this time.  I also wasn't really asking for game advice.  I didn't want to clutter the thread with game titles that are not likely of interest here, but here it goes:





Auran/NV3 Games Trainz TS12 and Trainz and New Era.  Both of these games are real train/model train simulators that have a very small market and certainly are never part of review site's selection of games for benchmarking.  Years ago I found SuperPI is very good for predicting TS12 performance when CPU bound and it was a common benchmark seen in reviews.  I have yet to find a common benchmark for the video card, but Heaven tracks video bound performance decently, but not as good as SuperPI tracks CPU.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Years ago doesn't work for today based on








	
	
		
		
			Ironically, that 30 FPS limitation helped the video card because I like lots of antialiasing.  When TANE came around, NV3 Game actually made some serious improvements in the CPU side of things, and running TS12 assets in TANE is no longer CPU limited.  TANE will hold a constant 60 FPS and might intermittently load one core to 70% at times, while the others bobble around 35%, and most of the time the primary thread is at about 48% load with the 2600K running at 4.9 GHz.  
		
		Click to expand...
	
Which suggests that the software is minimally but actually multithreaded, thus single threaded pi32 isn't going to give you a reasonable benchmark. This is based on the 2600k having 8 threads, 7 threads at 35% + one thread at 48% = 293% not 100%. (Rough calcs)



Which means that while it is not fully optimised, but incremental improvements may be made by more actual cores (rather than just HT) to throw threads at. You may see a significant enough difference with a CPU with 8 cores.








	
	
		
		
			That flips me back to the video card, because now I run the game at 50 FPS and there are places on the map the 1070TI cannot keep up.  It also raises another problem, the antialiasing on TANE in DX11 is horrid compared to DX9.  Also note that all those nice forced antialiasing modes in Nvidia Inspector don't work in DX11.  The game content is still quite dated, so DX11 doesn't look all that better.   TANE is quite capable at maxing out the 1070TI at 4K.  If I don't run it at 4K, the image quality is terrible which I suspect is from DX11, as TS12 in DX9 looks great at 1080P.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Here we get to the real story, the 1070Ti is not really a 4k card of any measure. DX9 and DX11 are completely different - DX11/12 are both much better threaded than DX9 in general. The NVidia drivers do a good job of threading in general, AMD didn't at last count but I haven't had an AMD card lately to compare.  To get 60FPS@4k generally you need the equivalent of a 1080ti, especially if you want AA. The 2070 is pretty good as an alternative.








	
	
		
		
			Makes me wish I could get enough CPU to run TS12 at 50 FPS and that would require about 125% improvement in IPC.  For those old enough, a doubling of performance (100%) used to happen in a few years, so waiting for 125% more didn't used to be such a big deal.
		
		Click to expand...
	
NVcontrol panel will potentially give you some extra features like TSAA/FXAA etc which may give you some benefits, there's also some shader addons for games you may be interested in.



Nvidia drivers use AVX256 if it is available, regardless of DX version.








	
	
		
		
			Aside from Trainz, I'd also like to see FSX run like FS9 does today.  While P3D represents further development past FSX, FSX has some features the P3D does not.  FSX was designed single threaded and I believe they targeted a 10GHz CPU.



So there's the why.  What I was really hoping for was somebody to pipe up that the Meltdown and Spectre fixes were holding back SuperPI scores.  It looks like my next spend will be in the video card department.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Per previous posts AND this post, superpi cannot be used as a yardstick..





To summarise, a more modern processor with more cores would give you:

-AVX256 to use with Nvidia drivers

-more actual cores therefore better core population based on the load

-more performance"

That most likely is a placebo effect cuase I use a amd and a intel at work , and the snapiness in the amd is no where close to my 9900k @ 50. Reason is easy amd takes a high hit on memory latency somewhere around 65ns on high end memory  when intel is around 39ns to 42ns. Also that's why intel hit higher fps in games. Latency is where you get the snappines. Even winrar is faster intel despite the core deficiency , which more core speed and the memory control so close to the processors on the die , it just get more cycles done quicker."

Did you do any benches of both setups at 4k gaming? 



On a similar x99 setup but with a 5930k and interested as to what your performance increase was, I can't believe I have had this for so long. Pretty stellar but sad that in 5 years NOTHING has been 'game changing' I used to LOVE the massive upgrades after 2/3 years.



Even on the gpu end its not huge. Is it snarky to admit I'm disappointed that things feel stagnant and it seems only AMD has stepped up their game.

Maybe, the bitcoin craze for GPUS made companies too cocky and they didn't foresee the need for faster setups as we moved to cloud performance for AI.



Sadly, this does not translate or help us pc users that want MORE RAW performance on one machine. 



A lot of my friends in tech all tell me that this is where the money had gone. Which one could surmise is the reason why there have not been significant upgrades / significant advances made. If one could take the current add more (I.e cpu/gpu stacked together) and kill it, then all you need to do is make that lore efficient at a corporate level and delay your R&D in the rest."

			The biggest deal with respect to marketshare at this point in time isn't performance (which affects price) but rather production capacity. AMD relies on third-party fabs, primarily TSMC, which has many greedy customers for its latest fabrication nodes.



Intel, on the other had, has to figure out how to continue to produce 14nm in volume because it works, while fixing 10nm for volume, if that's possible, while developing 7nm. The comment about farming out to Samsung makes sense, as Intel usually uses their oldest nodes for all of the other products they produce for themselves like chipsets and modems and networking ASICs and so on for others.



So yeah, while prices are going to fluctuate a bit, the biggest issue is what each company can actually deliver to their system integrators and retail customers. Demand is rising while both companies are in rolling transition phases, Intel with their fab struggles and AMD with record demand and without question a clear awareness that they must continue to meaningfully iterate on their current winning architectures, as while Intel cannot yet manufacture the designs that their engineers come up with, at some point in the future they most certainly will.





Biggest takeaway: AMD becomes credible, established competition across Intel's CPU product stack. Intel's fumble has created a wide opening for AMD to get their products into industry infrastructure and to continue to build on the massive mindshare Zen has built so far.

Just read :



Looks like Intel would completely lose their market share everywhere without any other hope like GPU. That's no businness at all for 3 years. They may have some hope for 2023 but AMD will be much much more advanced. They may only get to AMD 2021 level in 2023, if everything works well.Not sure about that because they are lying and unable to deliver for years. They may be back in 2025, meaning at best competitive, if all goes well.

After reading this, it looks very real, puts everything together so one can understand what's happening. Means if you have money, don't put it in Intel. Intel is totally overpriced today. Not necessarily look at AMD as a replacement. Look how well Ampere is doing and put it in Nvidia (not for gaming but for the server market and self driving cars), if you feel the need to invest in that business. Also TSMC, Samsung have bright future, not Intel.

Also Apple has a great ARM architecture that may very well go into servers. So this could be the end of life of x86 as a global architecture. Because no competition between AMD and Intel is in no way good even for AMD. There has never been so much technological distance between Intel and AMD than now between AMD and Intel and this distance will grow until 2023 when Intel will at best keep that distance steady."

Sad thing is that the test board was also X299! So its possible... I always did feel their x299 board was not on par to the z390 I have now but I just assumed it was due to the z390 being newer relatively speaking. Makes me want to seek out another board to test one last time before I totally give up on this thing.



 Yeah I wouldnt want to fix this unless its possible without ridiculous cost so Im hesitant to seek out professional remedies but it seems rare enough that there is no ""DIY"" on youtube for this! lol...

No idea. I haven't heard anything official about that. Given what Intel was able to do with Cascade Lake-X, I don't doubt it would be possible. But, without doing more than simply applying another optimization to Skylake, I can't see much point. Unless it clocked significantly higher, and there is no reason to think that it would, I don't think it will matter. It will still lose to a Ryzen 3950X in everything but gaming. Without hitting 5.2GHz or beyond, even that wouldn't be enough of a win to sway people."

The difference wasn't felt for years, but as the 2500K when overclocked remained viable for higher-end gaming during that time, the lack of HT was eventually felt.



But that was with four cores. 



Since game resource usage isn't linear, we really have no idea if a 9900K will be more or less useful than a 9700K for gaming eventually. HT might be significantly more useful, or both processors could become obsolete for high-end gaming for a different reason that they share.



We really don't know, and we can say that for gaming alone, today, a 9700K is a good buy, and that with respect to computing in general, isn't likely to become a bottleneck in the near-term.

The 10th gen is the ninth gen. The ninth is the eighth, the eighth the seventh, and the seventh the sixth. They're all Skylake cores with very minor adjustments.

The server market is both where Intel is in the most trouble, and at the same time, the one that will be slowest to change due to inertia. The question in my mind is just how much of a foothold AMD will gain; given that the market is expanding, where AMD loses sales to those organizations upgrading that are more resistant to change, just having the new hotness available to purchase in quantity makes them more attractive for new installations.



The longer Intel takes to get volume and performance back up, the more ground AMD will gain; I have an inkling that AMD won't gain as much as they rightly should given the quality of their products, but, I do expect them to have enough of a foothold to be able to maintain their presence and provide credible competition for the next decade at least."

Fortunately, I can buy a lot of EK stuff from online retailers in the U.S. I can even buy the parts over at my local Microcenter for reasonable enough prices. However, I have a GIGABYTE RTX 2080 Ti Aorus Xtreme 11G which is not a reference card. Only EK had the block available so I had to order it and the back plate for it from them directly. It was $236 shipped to my door for the block and back plate, plus importation fees. All in all, not bad as far as I am concerned.



I don't recall the exact costs, but it's something like this: 



EKWB 480mm Radiator - $89

Corsair 420mm Radiator - $69

Bitspower Fittings: - $150

EK Velocity RGB Waterblock - $109

EK RGB Res - $89

EK Quantum Vector Aorus Waterblock / EK Quantum Vector Aorus Backplate - $236

EKWB Waterpump $150



These aren't exact figures, but it comes out to just under $900. I may not have spent quite as much on fittings or even more when you add the drain setup etc. I also certainly spent some on hard tubing. I have no idea how much, but probably $50 between mistakes and just learning how to do it right. Also, my rig is huge so there is that. I needed a lot of tubing. So I might have gone over $1,000 in total now that I think about. I wish I hadn't thought about it. 



However, this doesn't mean your setup will cost that much. You can certainly get away with one radiator, or even a smaller one. You also don't necessarily need to spend as much on a GPU block. I also went with hard tubing and lots of trial and error made that costlier than it otherwise would have been. I could have also gone with a smaller res, dropped RGB, etc. So there are plenty of ways to get the costs down a bit."

			That's needless complex imo, and a bit wasteful. There's so much damn speed with gen3/4 nvme there's no need to dedicate separate drives to os and programs. There's also no need to run a separate page file either, unless you plan on swapping from page file, which is a sign of a bottlenecked system. I suggest one fat nvme for os/apps. Let windows manage pagefile, ie on os drive. Then you can run a 2nd nvme for scratch/assets etc etc.

			Basically Photoshop can run on anything these days.  You could run it competently on 7 year old hardware.  Photoshop's requirements basically haven't changed (in terms of hardware power necessary) since CS6.  It has become more optimized in terms of certain filters being able to use system resources better, but nothing that would change the workflow of a photographer or retoucher using Photoshop or Lightroom.

My 7 year old hardware is having a tough time making some local adjustments in Lightroom these days.  Just painting with the adjustment brush can be so slow as to be unworkable.  It was a good system back in the day, but it's time for an update.

As for AMD, I mentioned earlier that I have seen recent benchmarks and of course they are top of the line.  Going from Intel to AMD may not be exactly the same as giving up my Nikon gear for Canon, but change is not as easy as a snap of the finger.  That said, I believe I will take some time to review the AMD offerings.



Thank you all for your comments and suggestions.

The 6 virtual cores are (marginally) slower than the two real cores. The only reason to be on 8700k over a 9700k is cost. If you can find an 8700k for way less, sure. 

There is something to be said for next gen consoles both running 8 core CPUs. That may make 8 cores more relevant over the upcoming series of games. It may not though. No real way to tell."

My take, I can set full speed oc's that won't survive benchmarking but HWmonitor tells me that 8hr gaming sessions are really less than 50% use across cores.



I use low quality settings, bc I really don't enjoy frame drops down to 60-80fps bc of aesthetic environment complexity in a map.  Last BO4 update there are fog and static background sections that eat 100fps.

The problem is that while you can get pretty good numbers on a wide range of configurations, you will also see very low minimum frame rates at times. I've seen it down into the low 20's on various HEDT CPU's. The Threadripper 2920X fell into the mid-40 FPS range quite often despite me having an overclocked RTX 2080 Ti.  



Destiny 2 in places can actually have frame rate drops that go much lower than you'd imagine. This is especially true of HEDT CPU's.

Try Escalation Protocol on Mars, or the lost sector on Mars near Anna Bray. You can see these drops on some of the most powerful CPU's today. This happens even at 1080P. Sometimes these are quick drops in frame rates that feel like a momentary hitch. By the time you look at the FPS counter the issue is generally resolve. However, on CPU's like the Threadripper 2920X, (not pictured above) it wasn't the case. 



Yes, a GPU is a far more worth while upgrade. This is especially true given that the 7980XE, 9980XE and 10980XE are all damn near the same CPU.

The real difference is that the 7980XE used a shitty TIM under the heat spreader. That's why it benefits from delidding. The next model, the 9980XE has a soldered heatspreader. The main difference when you get up to the 10980XE is that it overclocks better and has four more PCIe lanes. If you've already got a 7980XE that can do 4.5GHz, I don't think an upgrade is really warranted. Not for the kind of money involved anyway. You may gain 200-300MHz of overclocking headroom. I put a beefy cooling solution on the 10980XE and 4.8GHz is the best I can do with it. You just can't feed them enough voltage to keep their temps under control and be 24/7 stable. 



Also, that increase in overclocking comes at a price:

It really depends on what you're doing with your computer.  I don't think you'd notice a big difference until you got into the high core count expensive processors.  For gaming, the mesh vs. the ring bus is going to tip performance to the mainstream parts over the HEDT.  And like I said to newls1, I don't know that you're going to notice a big difference between 8 and 10 cores.  If you're just buying z490 for the 10 cores CPU, you  might as well just get a Z390 now and a cheaper processor (grab a used one when someone upgrades).  If there a chipset feature you think you'd use, then by all means, get the z490."

My current theory and why Im looking for a pinout is because the CPU had damage on one of the gold pads. It basically flaked off! First time anything like this ever occurred. I have visually inspected everything else and all seems to be in order except the damage mentioned above and also the ""problem"" listed below. Always possible I damaged something on the top side during delid as well but I checked pics and it didnt indicate damage unless its not visible.



System:

i7-7820x - delidded using Rockit

G.Skill DDR4 CL14 3200Mhz (4x8 B-Die)

Gigabyte x299 Aorous Gaming 7





Problem:

Basically I cant get quad channel to work at OC speeds effectively on anything over 1.2v. So at 1.2v I see all four channels and through various reporting software it reports back quad channel at 2133. Strangely(?) I can get dual channel to work fine at OC speeds but it wont see 1 of the 4 sticks. RAM was working fine in quad channel with previous processor (7800x) and tested on my current gaming system. Also mobo was not the issue as I tested on another mobo with similar behavior.



Edit: Lastly if its a pin landing pad issue; can you even fix this?! and I thought I had a pic on my phone but its not there so I will post one this evening.



Can see its the middle towards the top but you can also see other areas where the gold is wearing off.

Fanboy at work again. You can't really think Ryzen is all that much better than Skylake refreshes. Clock for clock they are within error most of the time. AMD just caught up to a five year old architecture. I am glad they did, but Ryzen is not an Intel beater without the massive cache and core count, thus is still situatioinal advantagious. Ice Lake is showing massive IPC advantages over current tech, but it's vaporware ATM.

The latest price ""cuts"" bring Intel back on price parity with AMD - a 7552 is a 48c/96t for $4190, which gets you a pair of 6230R's over in Intel land (52c/104t) with a little bit of change left over. The AMD offering is certainly the way to go for hyperscaling (it's almost twice as dense), but the Intel offering has more PCI-e (3.0, which a lot of peripherals are still on), higher FP throughput, and better development and profiling tools, which makes it more attractive for smaller installations where density is less of an issue. Looking at the situation right now, Xeons are also available in more diverse form factors than Epycs - Tier 1 vendors are still just beginning to flesh out their AMD lineups.



My guess is that these prices are what the hyperscalers have *actually* been paying for Skylake Xeons the whole time, not the ludicrous $10K+ list prices on Intel's site. It would explain why they haven't all jumped ship to AMD (at the scale at which Amazon and friends deploy servers, it becomes worth it to reengineer a substantial fraction of the hardware and software stack to halve hardware costs and power consumption!), and it would at least partially explain why we've been able to get $10K Platinums on eBay for $2K since almost launch day.



This also represents a return to normalcy for high-end CPU prices - during the era of Westmere and Sandy Bridge, a pair of almost-flagships would run you around $2K a piece. Pricing really started slipping during the Haswell and Broadwell era (the 18C Haswells and 22C Broadwells were such a poor value proposition that I've never seen them in the wild before), and took a dive down the deep end when Skylake SP launched. I don't really have data for Skylake, but I would bet that most large deployments were using the trimmed down Xeon Golds, and not the 24/26/28c large processors."

Thats probably why you're not seeing the 5.0ghz, its also why your processor probably isnt overheating/temp throttling, as noted you need to fix that idle temp problem first.

			I'd have taken the 5960X to 4.4GHz or so. Both of mine did that and one went to 4.5GHz. I never heard of one that couldn't do 4.3GHz. Seems like a nice upgrade either way. I did the same thing actually. I had a 5960X for years and then ""upgraded"" to a Threadripper 2920X which turned out to be a step back in gaming performance. I then ended up on a 9900K.

As I am finding with the 9900KS - it's hard to get to what I call ""stable"" versus what others do. I could only get my 5960X to 4GHz for long-term stability. Anything more was a stretch and there would be occasional glitches or hiccups. I play MMORPG games like ARK: Survival Evolved where if I'm on a flying mount and my box crashes - done-zo.



I am happy with the 9900KS and it is a nice upgrade, but probably not a necessary one at all. I just had not built in several years and was really getting the itch. I almost went with a pre-built because I have been pretty busy but I talked myself off that ledge and enjoyed this build. Went real slow and did it over two days because, you know, now I have kid responsibilities and such so it is harder to get that 4 hour block of time haha.

			Agreed with Dan thats way too high for idle high 30s low 40s should be idle unless your ambient temp is 38c, I would reseat the cooler and reapply thermal paste

However I disagree about the 360mm AIO giving you noticably better cooling.



Fact of the matter the 9900k runs really hot, 90c+ is super common running stress tests especially running 5.0 with no AVX offset.

Check this post here: https://hardforum.com/posts/1044534570/

He's got a custom loop with a 360 rad and its still 90+ during stress tests



I have the H110i GTX which is the older model of your same 280mm cooler.

I had the same experience and due to cooling limitation and comfortably I opted for 5.0Ghz with a 2 AVX.

Set this way I don't exceed 70c during normal workloads, and stress tests max out in the mid 80c.



Additional thoughts:

1) What mode is your pump set to? (Set it to performance, it should be reporting about 3k RPM if you have corsair link installed)

2) What fans are you using? Are they set to run 100% all the time or are they temp based?

3) You have a 280mm aio currently, a 360mm aio is only going to give you about 5% better cooling (it only has about 9% more volume by area depending on the depth) not worth the replacement cost IMO.



Edit:

Just saw your note about quiet but cool performance.

So for my setup I have the pump run at full (3k RPM), its barely audible by itself with nothing turned on in my case.

The fans I have as a push/pull, the two pull fans are low 800rpm silent fans that run 100% all the time.

The push fans are the default corsair ones that are temperature controlled and only turn on when CPU hits 60c.



Its almost 0 audible noise but the faintest whisper except when gaming when I have my headset on anyway.
		
		Click to expand...
	
The pump speed is set to the extreme on the icue software with the fans on the quiet mode I am using the ML 140 fans that came with the cooler I most likely switch them out for some noctua fans. Since the temps for an i9 are like that I will most likely change the fans and keep the cooler. I had one question with the AVX offset at 2 on your pc how where you able to achieve the 5 GHZ overclock the problem that I am having with my cpu is that it is just sitting at the stock turbo speed."

What we saw around the release of the 4000-series, with frametimes / 1% lows suffering without SMT, may or may not be repeated as sharply.



Consider that while game demands on the CPU are likely to increase significantly, OS / background demands likely aren't. Also, while game demands increase, they may or may not increase in a way that utilizes SMT, or put another way, they may or may not increase in a uniform mix of INT / FP / SIMD / etc. If the increase is more INT biased, then SMT may make more of a difference.







As for obsolescence, aside from streaming demands that can probably be hoisted almost entirely on GPUs (or IGPs, looking at you AMD), demands for increased security throughout the hardware and software stack might come into play. Stuff like using containerization concepts prolifically and scrambling or encrypting data in memory or other full-stack mitigation approaches could bring requirements that current processors are ill suited to fulfill."

That seemed like a decent upgrade to me.



Now running a 1680v2 at 4.6Ghz and the 2 extra cores and way more cache did help in some things.



I know the 1660v3 (5960x equivilant) is not going to be much of all of an upgrade CPU wise but the newer platform features are more of what I am after.



I did look into the 68xx/69xx CPUs but those seemed to have too many issues with randomly dying and the price is still too high anyway.



I also have an x99 board I got for super cheap due to bent socket pins that I already repaired.



Also have an one of the highest end ASUS x99 boards that I got for super cheap as well. Fixed almost all the bent pins on that one but there were a couple broken ones and thus only 3 memory channels work. Already bought a replacement socket that I am going to use a couple pins to fix the broken pins.



I already have a 1650v3 that came out of a Dell machine but it seems to be a bad overclocker."

Intel's fabs have caused all kinds of trouble, and given their history, a four-year slip really is 'lucky' for AMD. Had Intel's fabs not slipped, Zen would have looked a lot like Bulldozer on release. Zen 2 would be just 'okay'.



And yeah, reaching Skylake IPC but not clockspeeds with a node advantage is 'just okay'."

10 years ago it was unthinkable that a company like Intel would ever cease to exist.  But with their stagnation and leaps forward with other CPU tech (like ARM), their end is conceivably within sight (not saying it will happen, just that it's within the realm of possibility).

With all the investment into infrastructure necessary and the high degree of specialized manufacturing to make microprocessors as well as heck, just the brains to design a microprocessor, it was basically impossible for other entrants to enter the market.  But here we are.

Cascade Lake-X launched some time ago. Although, few of the CPU's have actually been available for purchase. Here is the deal: If you have a delidded 7980XE that can do 4.5GHz, it probably isn't worth the upgrade. You'll be spending a lot of money to maybe reach 4.7 or 4.8GHz. That's about all these are good for given how hot they get. Delidding won't do as much for these either as they have a soldered TIM. The CPU itself is essentially the same except for supporting additional RAM and having a 48 PCIe lanes instead of 44. 



Also, the Core i9 10980XE CPU's should cost about $1,100. Any more than $1,200 and you are blatantly getting ripped off."

Ok, I've got it downloaded and running.  Never have tried this particular version, but it is acting as expected.  I'll put some sessions together to gather Fraps framerate data for the classic a la [H]ardOCP ""maximum playable settings"" type graph.  In the meantime, here is quick and dirty test that can be used to synchronize settings:



Keep the 1080TI as fast as possible, don't enable any extra anti-aliasing settings, the goal is to see how the CPU is limiting frames.  No vsync either to cap frames.  Make sure the settings in the Nvidia driver for the game are at defaults.  I'm using Win7 64 and Nvidia driver 436.02, but I don't think that will matter.



1) Start the game and click Options

2) Don't need to change General or Planet Auran Tabs.

3) On the Display Settings tab select Directx, 1920x1080, 32 bit, fullscreen, Aspect Ratio Auto, Antialias Mode 2

4) On the Advanced Options tab select Vertical Sync Auto, Frequency Auto, and uncheck Shadows.

5) On the Developer Tab set the Asset Backups to 0

6) Click Ok

7) Click Start  (The first time you run this it will do a database rebuild)

8) Click Select Route

9) Select Route Norfolk & Western - Appalachian Coal

10) Select Eastbound Coal Train

11) Close the dialog boxes

12) Go into the menu in the upper left corner

13) Select video settings and   Set them to:

          Max Draw Distance: 4000m

          Scenery Detail: High

          Tree Detail: Ultra

          Texture Detail: High

          Anisotropy: 16 Highest

         Close the settings

14) Wait for the opening scene to fully load.  Once the view stops populating, what is your frame rate? What is your video card load?



As the scene loads the frame rate will drop.  I end up at 32FPS with a video card load of 20% at 1607MHz on my 1070TI.  1080TI should be able to do this no sweat.



I'm curious what you get with the 9900K and ~35% more video card.  Thank you for doing this.

			Reading is fundamental:







My measurement techniques are very tied to what I actually do with this machine, never suggested they were appropriate for other use cases.







Which is my point for my use case, I can't go back and add new instructions to my single threaded apps -> I want my platform to run my older software faster as newer software isn't realistically on the table, thus no IPC nor performance bump for me.



This is a big reason YMMV is so significant this time around.  Core2Duo made everything faster, Sandy Bridge made everything faster, no new software required.  This time around the software needs to use the new instructions and/or needs to be multi-threaded to really get a lift.







I wrote that poorly, I didn't mean to imply that was the only reason for the demise of [H]ardOCP and I'm aware of what happened.  That said, a lot of other sites have disappeared as well.

Well, unless your 2600K can hit 5.0GHz, a 9900K will be faster. It took a lot to get a 2600K to 5.0GHz but its relatively easy on a 9900K. You can  do it with a simple decent AIO.  There are also other advances that help. Cache improvements and so on. In any case, 



As for review sites, there are a number of reasons why many of them dried up. That would be its own post if I wanted to get into that. Each site would have its own story, but in general YouTube was a major factor for the shift away from the traditional review site. Many of them died off because they were mismanaged."

			That's the only thing that bugs me about your post; saying ""Ryzen is not an Intel beater without the massive cache and core count"" to me would be like saying ""Intel wouldn't have beat AMD if it weren't for higher IPC and etc etc"" or ""the only reason a V8 has more power than a straight 4 is because of the extra cylinders. Uhh yeah, that's kinda the point. You're right, AMD wouldn't be competitive with Intel if it weren't for the cache and core count but that's part of the architecture that has put AMD in the place it is. The cache and cores is also why AMD has seemed to show such relatively large performance gains when paired with faster tighter memory and Intel CPU's don't care as much about memory speed. You could say Intel's IMC is better than AMD's since it doesn't care about memory speed but you could also say the AMD CPU is so hungry for data to process (and therefore the Intel isn't) that we need faster memory to keep it fed. I guess it comes down to how you want to spin the situation. BTW I'm also being a bit of a devil's advocate here so take my post with a grain of salt, so to speak.



Edit: Not trying to pick a fight, just that it bug's me when someone says ""the only reason X is ahead/better than Y is because they did Z different"". Doesn't matter why they're competitive/ahead; fact of the matter is they did something that worked and that's that. And don't say ""well if Intel hadn't stagnated then AMD wouldn't be competitive"". That's not productive conversation because the fact of the matter is Intel f*cked up during the same time that AMD made some good decisions and came up with an architecture that is working for them with a seemingly good future and that's that.

Well my point is, core to core, clock for clock, AMD is about equal now, not surpassing Intel, which the post I waas quoting from the fanboy was alluding. Sure, you can say ""AMD still does better chip for chip"", but you can just run more Intel cores as well, if you want to waste your money. The true test of the architecture's performance is single core IPC, the test you are refering to is scalability. Scalability is important too, jsut not as indicative of advancment. There are lots of ways to get to the finish line first, but what you are driving and what track you are on will be the largest factors (driver skill bieng equal). Similarly, a I4 can produce more power than a V8, it all depends on how much air and fuel it is pushing, and what load it has to pull. The design of the motor is the contributing factor to how efficient it can achieve the goal you set for it. So if your workload will benefit from core/ thread count, then AMD is going to be the value bar none. But if you say want the best framerate in games at 1080p like me, and do nothing else, the lowly 6c/6t 9600K has slightly more value even at stock.



AMD has improved IPC to match Intel, as well as developed a platform for easy scalability on the package. But again, Intel has done nothing since Skylake, and not much more than that since Sandybridge, to improve IPC outside of specific instrustion sets. You get DDR4 and some iGPU advances, but that's about it. More cores and cache is the route they took as well, just before AMD did it, and AMD beat them at that game due to a better node and package design. But in the end, if power and money are not an issue, you can throw more consumer grade Intel cores in a machine, and beat a machine with the same number of AMD cores.

However I disagree about the 360mm AIO giving you noticably better cooling.



Fact of the matter the 9900k runs really hot, 90c+ is super common running stress tests especially running 5.0 with no AVX offset.

Check this post here: https://hardforum.com/posts/1044534570/

He's got a custom loop with a 360 rad and its still 90+ during stress tests



I have the H110i GTX which is the older model of your same 280mm cooler.

I had the same experience and due to cooling limitation and comfortably I opted for 5.0Ghz with a 2 AVX.

Set this way I don't exceed 70c during normal workloads, and stress tests max out in the mid 80c.



Additional thoughts:

1) What mode is your pump set to? (Set it to performance, it should be reporting about 3k RPM if you have corsair link installed)

2) What fans are you using? Are they set to run 100% all the time or are they temp based?

3) You have a 280mm aio currently, a 360mm aio is only going to give you about 5% better cooling (it only has about 9% more volume by area depending on the depth) not worth the replacement cost IMO.



Edit:

Just saw your note about quiet but cool performance.

So for my setup I have the pump run at full (3k RPM), its barely audible by itself with nothing turned on in my case.

The fans I have as a push/pull, the two pull fans are low 800rpm silent fans that run 100% all the time.

The push fans are the default corsair ones that are temperature controlled and only turn on when CPU hits 60c.



Its almost 0 audible noise but the faintest whisper except when gaming when I have my headset on anyway."

Here’s how much the prices have changed, from memory, from yesterday:





i3-9100F:              Was $79.99 and is now at $139.99



i3-9100:                Was $119.99 and is now $139.99



i5-9400F:              Was $139.99 and is now $199.99



i5-9400:                Was $169.99 and is now $249.99



i7-8700K:              Was $279.99 and is now $399.99



For reference, the i5-9600K is still priced at $179.99, $70 cheaper than the inferior i5-9400. I'm speechless.



Please tell me these are just pricing errors.

Well, well, does that make them better ?

It seems it's more a matter of non delivery. It looks like Intel has stopped production on plenty of their products. The only Intel products still somehow profitable are servers and laptops but this is going down too. Server market is based on already in place everything around Intel and still Intel contracts for several years. Laptop market is still there based on AMD Renoir not yet out. So server CPU need plenty of wafer surface and laptops is the only PC market left for Intel. Why would they lose money on Desktops where people building their own PC know what they put inside. So they just don't produce enough to satisfy Intel even diminishing number of fans."

I'm glad that AMD finally put some pressure on Intel since we're now getting 8+ cores in the mainstream. However, if AMD become complacent (remember Netburst vs K8 and then Conroe vs Phenom?), intel will crush them again with their (dirty) tactics and money.



And where most of the money is made (enterprise), the decision maker is usually the business guy, not the technical guy. This is simply a case of ""nobody ever got fired for buying Cisco network equipment"" with Intel being Cisco here.

While you are primarily GPU bound, CPU is very important in higher resolution gaming. I tested Destiny 2 for my Ryzen 9 3900X review and of course, I couldn't make it work on the Ryzen 3000 series so I dropped that content. However, I did the tests on my Threadripper 2920X and the 9900K. Here is the data from those two:



-----------------------------------------Intel

Intel Core i9 9900K @ Stock

Min                Max                Avg

54.2              121.7              74.8



Intel Core i9 9900K @ 5.0GHz (All core)

Min                Max                Avg

56.7              129.7              81.7



-----------------------------------------AMD

AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2 2920X @ PBO

Min                Max                Avg

36.4              113.1              79.4



AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2 2920X @ 4.3GHz Manual (All core) 

Min                Max                Avg

26.3              138.8              79.9



As you can see, the Core i9 9900K had higher minimum frame rates and a higher average. The Threadripper actually pulled a higher maximum frame rate, This was at 4K, maximum settings, V-Sync off, etc. Granted, the minimums you see on the Threadripper system weren't something you would necessarily feel in the game or even see that much. Those dips are very rare and occurred for something like 3 frames. On that same display with V-Sync on, the Intel never dropped below 60FPS no matter what your doing. The Threadripper system actually drops into the upper mid-40's quite often when things get crazy. So your CPU does matter. Threadripper is literally the worse case for AMD due to its CCX layout and the number of CCX complexes. A Ryzen 7 2700X out performs the Threadripper 2920X at every turn in gaming, but their performance isn't massively far apart either. In most of my tests, those two weren't all that different.



Ryzen 3000 closes the gap quite a bit, but don't kid yourself, Intel is still king at gaming. Whether or not the hit you take is acceptable to you is a personal choice. Usually its small, but there are some cases where the hit is still over 10%. If your at 4K @ 60Hz, that's noticeable. If your at 144Hz and your actual FPS is greater than that, you won't ever see it. Especially if you are using some form of variable refresh rate technology."

Exactly right. However, there is one caveat to this. The Cascade Lake-X chips can overclock quite well. I don't know where the ceiling is on the 10900X, but the 10980XE actually seems like it could do 5.1GHz if you could actually cool the damn thing. On water cooling, you can't feed it enough voltage to keep it stable and keep it cool enough to keep it stable at the same time. You would also think that chips with fewer cores would do better, but according to Intel, this isn't true in Cascade Lake-X's case."

			Fanboy at work again. You can't really think Ryzen is all that much better than Skylake refreshes. Clock for clock they are within error most of the time. AMD just caught up to a five year old architecture. I am glad they did, but Ryzen is not an Intel beater without the massive cache and core count, thus is still situatioinal advantagious. Ice Lake is showing massive IPC advantages over current tech, but it's vaporware ATM.



Where is your substance? If you are provoked by that post, it's a problem with your brain, not our remarks.

That's the only thing that bugs me about your post; saying ""Ryzen is not an Intel beater without the massive cache and core count"" to me would be like saying ""Intel wouldn't have beat AMD if it weren't for higher IPC and the mhz advantage and etc etc"" or ""the only reason a V8 has more power than a straight 4 is because of the extra cylinders. Uhh yeah, that's kinda the point. You're right, AMD wouldn't be competitive with Intel if it weren't for the cache and core count but that's part of the architecture that has put AMD in the place it is. The cache and cores is also why AMD has seemed to show such relatively large performance gains when paired with faster tighter memory and Intel CPU's don't care as much about memory speed. You could say Intel's IMC is better than AMD's since it doesn't care about memory speed but you could also say the AMD CPU is so hungry for data to process (and therefore the Intel isn't) that we need faster memory to keep it fed. I guess it comes down to how you want to spin the situation. BTW I'm also being a bit of a devil's advocate here so take my post with a grain of salt, so to speak.



Edit: Not trying to pick a fight, just that it bug's me when someone says ""the only reason X is ahead/better than Y is because they did Z different"". Doesn't matter why they're competitive/ahead; fact of the matter is they did something that worked and that's that. And don't say ""well if Intel hadn't stagnated then AMD wouldn't be competitive"". That's not productive conversation because the fact of the matter is Intel f*cked up during the same time that AMD made some good decisions and came up with an architecture that is working for them with a seemingly good future and that's that."

The biggest deal with respect to marketshare at this point in time isn't performance (which affects price) but rather production capacity. AMD relies on third-party fabs, primarily TSMC, which has many greedy customers for its latest fabrication nodes.



Intel, on the other had, has to figure out how to continue to produce 14nm in volume because it works, while fixing 10nm for volume, if that's possible, while developing 7nm. The comment about farming out to Samsung makes sense, as Intel usually uses their oldest nodes for all of the other products they produce for themselves like chipsets and modems and networking ASICs and so on for others.



So yeah, while prices are going to fluctuate a bit, the biggest issue is what each company can actually deliver to their system integrators and retail customers. Demand is rising while both companies are in rolling transition phases, Intel with their fab struggles and AMD with record demand and without question a clear awareness that they must continue to meaningfully iterate on their current winning architectures, as while Intel cannot yet manufacture the designs that their engineers come up with, at some point in the future they most certainly will.





Biggest takeaway: AMD becomes credible, established competition across Intel's CPU product stack. Intel's fumble has created a wide opening for AMD to get their products into industry infrastructure and to continue to build on the massive mindshare Zen has built so far."

I'm glad that AMD finally put some pressure on Intel since we're now getting 8+ cores in the mainstream. However, if AMD become complacent (remember Netburst vs K8 and then Conroe vs Phenom?), intel will crush them again with their (dirty) tactics and money.



And where most of the money is made (enterprise), the decision maker is usually the business guy, not the technical guy. This is simply a case of ""nobody ever got fired for buying Cisco network equipment"" with Intel being Cisco here."

			I'm trying to decide which processor to get for a new build.  Initially I was going to go for the i9-9900K.



I'm considering the i9-10900X for the additional PCIe lanes.  I haven't been able to determine if the extra lanes would be helpful for me so I'm hoping for some feedback based on the following details of my planned build and usage.



- I'm not a hard core gamer.  At most I'll play something like WoW

- I'm a photographer and use the latest versions of Lightroom and Photoshop

- At this time, no other intensive programs

- Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 graphics card

- Two M.2 NVMe Samsung 970 PRO 512 GB SSDs (one as Win 10 boot drive, one as program drive)

- Two 120GB SATA SSDs (one for Windows paging file, one for Photoshop scratch disk)

- Two 480GB SATA SSDs (quick access for things like Lightroom catalog and previews, and raw cache, and whatever)

- Additional large SATA HDDs for data and photos



So, would the  extra PCIe lanes be beneficial with this setup, or am I just naively barking up a shiny tree?



Thanx,

People are getting a bit off topic.  But I think what advice has been given thus far for the most part has been good.

I'll add just some side commentary:  Basically Photoshop can run on anything these days.  You could run it competently on 7 year old hardware.  Photoshop's requirements basically haven't changed (in terms of hardware power necessary) since CS6.  It has become more optimized in terms of certain filters being able to use system resources better, but nothing that would change the workflow of a photographer or retoucher using Photoshop or Lightroom.  The only exception to this is if you're working with incredibly large files.  If you're shooting on a 100MP or 150MP PhaseOne back, then the requirements go up.  But either processor and a 2070 is still plenty for that type of work.

If you decide to get into video editing, that is an entirely different ballgame, and then you really do want the absolute fastest hardware possible.



So that said, either processor is fine.  I personally would go for the 10900X just for the two extra cores.  It won't help you in Photoshop but things are slowly getting more multi-threaded.  It's rare to want to buy things to future-proof them, but if your business expands and you want to get into video editing then you'll have the cores there to work with (provided you use a good NLE like DaVinci Resolve that will actually utilize your hardware properly unlike Premiere).

You don't want or need so many separate drives.  I agree with the others that have stated: you absolutely will not saturate a single NVME drive even if you OS, Photoshop, AND the file you're working on were all on the same drive.  In fact with enough RAM, say 32GB of RAM, Photoshop will literally load the entire image into RAM.  It won't even touch your harddrive except while saving.

Also most NVME drives exceed 2000MB/s read/write and some more than 3500MB/s read/write.  There aren't any things that Windows+Photoshop+PSD file can do that would ever get close to saturate that.



If you want more NVME drives just to store stuff on, that's one thing.  But having separate drives to increase your speed isn't necessary, nor will it give you any speed increase.  You won't need a scratch disk.  You're working out Windows XP level ideas.  Things have changed.  Just buy more RAM.  The paging file nor the scratch disk should essentially never be touched.  You won't need more lanes, not for this kind of work."

			You can get a 12 core AMD 3900x for the same or less than a 9900k. And it has native PCI-E 4 support. Or you can save some cash and get AMD's 8 core 3700X and still have that PCI-E support. Also, waaaaaaay less vulnerabilities to patch on AMD processors.

Yeah and potentially more unpatched vulnerabilities that are not public, and more software/hardware maturity issues. Question is whether this matters to you, typically it doesn't matter.



WRT Virtual memory, YMMV - While I don't need virtual memory (I have 64 gig of memory, I typically use somewhere in the order of 15-20 gig, and often a lot more), I have a 32gig optane with a fixed swap size that I use for virtual memory, I've noticed bootup is faster and things are snappier as a result of taking the swap off the nvme, and windows still uses virtual memory for parking."

So technically if the board is designed to share 4 lanes on 44 lane chips they could write in a BIOS update for that to no longer be shared and spread it out correct?



For example. My X299 Dark has the 1st m.2 drive shared with the two u.2 ports so you can one one or the other and the second m.2 slot is shared with a x4 PCIE Slot on the board. Could a bios update make it so ONE of those is no longer shared? Or is it not that simple?"

It might be dependent on the Rom size.  Most x299 only have 128 Mb (16MB) Bios size, it may be hard to upgrade.   Some of the current x299 bios sizes are 12 MB or more already, so hopefully Cascade does not add alot to the micro code.  



I would hope the new x299 boards are 256 Mb like the x570, but I imagine more are concerned with forward compatibility than backwards compatibility."

That's needless complex imo, and a bit wasteful. There's so much damn speed with gen3/4 nvme there's no need to dedicate separate drives to os and programs. There's also no need to run a separate page file either, unless you plan on swapping from page file, which is a sign of a bottlenecked system. I suggest one fat nvme for os/apps. Let windows manage pagefile, ie on os drive. Then you can run a 2nd nvme for scratch/assets etc etc."

I can't tell you how many times I've heard people at Microcenter say that the Ryzen 3000's are better than Intel CPU's across the board. They seem unaware or largely ignore the gaming advantage or specific advantages Intel may hold at certain price points. I think the issue is that people look at benchmarks and if they see the bulk of scores favoring one product, they make a blanket conclusion that said product is just better than the other. They do not dwell on the details or even acknowledge that a given task may favor one or the other. I think people see that AMD's Ryzen 3000 series is close enough on the gaming front and faster everywhere else, so they conclude that all Ryzen's are better than all Intel CPU's.



This simply isn't accurate though. The 9400F vs. the 3400G was something I tested and surprisingly, I found the 9400F was better in the vast majority of cases. Now, the 3400G is cheaper and the APU part of it is undoubtedly faster, but as a budget gaming CPU with a discreet card, the 9400F is faster hands down. When you look at a 3700X vs. a 9900K, it isn't so cut and dry either. The latter is more expensive, but in our tests the 9900K was faster than the Ryzen 7 3700X the vast majority of the time. Yet, that's not what one would conclude listening to people speak on the subject. If you compare the 3900X to the Core i9 9900K, the 3900X is the clear winner in most people's minds. However, if all you do is play games, Intel still has an advantage, albeit a small one. This often gets ignored by the general public.



I think people glance at the reviews and the data points, reach a conclusion and call it a day. Often, when you dive into the details with one of these people you'll find that they don't really know the data. They'll reference a review or something and if you read it, you'll probably find that their opinions or conclusions are only vaguely supported. That is, XYZ is faster most of the time, but doesn't take into account a great many variables. On the other hand, if I'm asked a question about what someone should buy and I know they don't have the knowledge to really get into the weeds on the subject, I'll probably just tell them to buy a Ryzen 7 3700X. They may erroneously conclude that the 3000 series is better in every way than XYZ Intel, based on what I said, but they won't know why I said that. They'll just parot the recommendation plus whatever justification I gave for it as best as they can recall it.



For example: Many will conclude that the Ryzen 9 3950X is better than Intel's Core i9 10980XE. Is it? Well that depends on how you look at it. You can certainly make many arguments for why the 3950X is the better buy. I certainly have done so. But being a better buy doesn't actually make it the better product. Looking at raw performance data, the Intel is often faster at stock speeds. If you look at the data, the Intel doesn't even win by enough to justify its cost increase. If you can handle cooling it and overclock the Core i9 10980XE far enough, it's a better performer in nearly every test you can throw at it. Plus, it comes with the advantages offered by being an HEDT part. But, again, raw performance and overclocked performance do not necessarily make for a good buy. The Intel Core i9 10980XE is super expensive, rare as hen's teeth, runs hot as hell and pulls considerably more power than the Ryzen 9 3950X does.



So, with all the data points beyond raw performance, I think most would conclude the Ryzen 9 3950X is better and the 10980XE isn't even worth considering as a viable purchase option. And to that, I'd generally agree.



if you are looking at CPU's, understand that prior to the Ryzen 3000 series, AMD was only superior if it had a core count advantage. It was also often better for the money, providing more bang for your buck. AMD's strength lied in giving you upwards of twice as many cores for the same money as their Intel counterparts. This also allowed AMD an advantage in some multi-threaded workloads. It wasn't until the 3000 series that AMD really had an advantage in most cases. Do keep in mind that all of the lower end AMD CPU's with onboard APU's are based on the Zen+ architecture and are 3000 series Ryzens in name only."

If there's an argument for the 9900K, it would be more forward-looking. The 2600K was no faster than the 2500K upon release, but the 2600K certainly aged better, as did its HT-equipped successors.

If you want more IPC , just wait for Zen 3.  All Intel is doing is adding more cores.

The key thing the intel 2xxx series doesn’t have is AVX-256, which when used can speed things up by a fair (5-25%) amount, sometimes more depending on the workload.



So for single thread performance if you have similar clocks and don’t use it, then you won’t see a huge difference. (5%-10% tops)

Posting my first results.  To note, I ran this five times with a reboot for the last 3.  I also used HWiNFO64 to watch clocks and also see C-States.  I noticed that the northbridge did not always ""report"" the proper 4300clk, and that also the L2 write would fluctuate.  This would most likely be due to C-States, and still similar.  One thing that I noticed is that your memory might not be using XMP because it is similar to mine, and that you may still be on a beta.  Gigabyte, correct?  The alpha by the numeric is usually beta notation.  Perhaps check up on firmware and memory configuration.  Firmware though can create a whole new issue with your overclocking.

			They have just pulled an a64, beaten Intel everywhere except a few games and using significantly (or many times) less power. And at lower clocks, thus AMD IPC is higher than Intel. Only thing keeping them relevant is clocking 14nm to the limit.



I guess we have not seen the same benchmarks?

I had multiple a64/opteron rigs and they were much the same. Few games and certain video editing niches Intel were competitive in.

This is no different.



Ice lake IPC is going to be a little higher but the clocks also lower on 10nm. Certianly not going to see the fabled 20-30% claims. Only time you will see that is comparing unmitigated cpus to next gen.



AMD however has a newly established reputation of making very accurate IPC claims. Intel marketing currently has almost zero trustworthiness.

So I'm not sure dead or unnecessary is true.



I mean if you have only 20 lanes with a mainstream AMD platform you can only have one graphics card and one NVME and that's it!?!?



I just recently discovered the wonderful world of enterprise cache SSDs used off ebay.  3.2TB of NVME speed storage, used for $200.  (4 PCI-E lanes) or 6.4TB of $400 (8 PCI-E lanes).  They support RAID arrays in whatever multiples your motherboard can handle.  If you wanted multiples for a RAID 0 or RAID 5, you'd likely need HEDT.   Sure you could use spinning rust, or old school SATA SSDs, but why, they cost more than these Enterprise SSDs $/TB, and are are multiples of slower, and literally about 1/100 of the endurance rating (new vs. new).  (My OS drive is a Samsung 860 EVO = 200TB endurance rating, vs. my Fusion I/O Scale's 20PB endurance rating).

https://hardforum.com/threads/3-2tb-ssd-for-240.1991865/

I recently moved my gaming hard-drive from a 10TB RAID 0 array, to that Fusion I/O Scale 3.2TB drive and that surprised me with how much difference it made.  I had a 2TB Firecuda SSHD before that, and the RAID array and the firecuda felt pretty similar as a games drive.

Hunt Showdown textures would take about 10 seconds, at least, to load in once a level launched on the RAID array with max settings at 3440x1440.  It was during the time the game is paused for all players, allowing everyone to load in - so I figured that was mostly normal.  Both my Seagate SSHD and my RAID 0 array did that.  On the Fusion I/O scale everything is loaded up from the very first moment the screen lights up in game.  Pretty cool.



I'm still on x99, and 6850K at 4.0Ghz.  If it was an 8 core I'd stay here for another few cycles.  The system is rock solid stable.  I haven't had a crash in so long I can't remember.  Maybe never.  When I tried to run my system at 4.1 to 4.3Ghz on all cores I'd get the occasional crash.  At 4.0Ghz on all cores, I don't think it's ever crashed, and with gaming at 3440x1440 - I'm not sure I'm missing much of anything --- yet.  Maybe after next gen consoles come out with their 8 core/16 thread base for both Sony and Microsoft, we'll start seeing game engines update to push for more cores/threads.  The other little trend I've noticed for myself at least is I've played increasingly more indie type game titles, which don't always require the most powerful hardware.  I haven't found a single game that can't run maxed out on my 6850K with a 2080 at 3440x1440 at ~70FPS average plus at max settings (Except Kingdom Come Deliverance which says it's ultra settings are for next gen hardware that isn't even out yet, and even with that I can still get 40FPS mins with everything maxed out).  Gsysnc further eliminates concerns about seeing lower FPS.  Everything feels pretty dang smooth to me down to just under 40FPS with Gsysnc on my Alienware aw3418dw.



I'm curious to know if you can tell any difference in your gaming after you spend some time with the 9900KS.  As several in this thread already posted.  I'm not buying something immediately, but I am starting to plot my course.  Probably either Ryzen gen 4, or maybe Intel's next go round.

That said, while IPC has basically stagnated post-CFL, I think the combination of both high clocks (5GHz) and the IPC bump on current Intel platform could present some value. I wouldn't buy new, but used. But even then, there's no rush to upgrade either. I'm only on 4/4, and NGL, that Ryzen 3000-series roll out was disappointing. Maybe Ryzen refresh (Zen 3, 4000-series) gives Ryzen the clock headroom for the undisputed lead for good.

I did not hear about that 10 core CPU. I just had the upgrade itch and the 9900KS looked pretty good (versus the 9900K) and didn't cost much more. I like that the 9900KS seems to have the Kyle Bennett touch.

No doubt that Chip is sweet. Tbh of new NVIDIA gpu’s were out in the wild I would have pulled the trigger already. For me thought without the gpu upgrade along with new cpu mb ram etc I don’t feel I’m getting as much shelf life out of my platform. Since that chipset is gonna be eol soon.



I probably wouldn’t even bother over clocking that KS personally. 5ghz all core stable out of the box is yummy af lol.



Ya supposedly a10 core 20 thread version of the.9900k is supposed to drop quarter one. It’s still a 14nm+++ wtfever though. So if I can get 10 core running at least all core stable 4.8-5.0 I’m good on a new chipset which gives me at least one more or two upgrades down the road I’m good."

			Speaking of the 7820X, that's what I'm currently using at 4.7Ghz and I'm not sure what to upgrade to next.  I was thinking either a 3950X next year when prices have come down, or just waiting for the Ryzen 4xxx series.



The 7820X is no slouch, but I feel like tinkering with something new.

7820x & x299 was a solid platform for recording/streaming while playing.

It handled my Kubernetes and Sec related home labbing like a champ with 128gb of ram and a pair of 960 pros.

If you are at 4.7ghz I see no reason to upgrade unless you have a workflow or personal interest that demands change.



I went Ryzen bc I was on this weird trip where was playing vids instead of using my free time for anything professionally valuable.

I got a cheapie b450 and 1200 setup, 2600 came later, then a 1700x fell into my lap.

Ryzen arc became interesting after 1903 hit mainstream channel.

Any Ryzen build before 3200 ram stability updates and windows scheduler upgrades must have been miserable.

I got to round robbing cpus to see what I was doing would be affected by cpu resources.

I took an interest in wsl2 that faded quickly once I found the ragged beta issues.



Once a bunch of my interests were satisfied I went right back to an Intel build once I got the Sec certification I was chasing.

I can feel the 1% lows in the games I play, something is just off with Ryzen in the way game builds work on it.

I’ll stick with what I have for a while.



More than likely I’ll end up issued a 16” MacBook Pro for 2020, I like the new keyboard, I’ll spend most of my professional Dev time on that.

			There are leaks, that Intel is ready to launch Comet Lake. Another Skylake version with 2 more cores on a new socket LGA 1200. Seems like the speed is a little under what was expected so this is new bad news.

Fact is nobody may expect for LGA1200 to live longer than AM4, and eventually will have a shorter life since AM4 is expected to support Zen 3 in 2020 and 2021. 10 core will need 140 TDP support on the motherboard.

In fact the launch of Comet Lake for Desktop looks like as awkward as Skylake X HEDT. Hope they drop their price since one still won't have ECC RAM would need to go for 490 chipset for Raid feature. All this is offered by AMD on all their CPU line (and APU from the Pro line). Not a big deal for Intel to put those features ON on all their products. Intel is so unattractive.

			The server market is both where Intel is in the most trouble, and at the same time, the one that will be slowest to change due to inertia. The question in my mind is just how much of a foothold AMD will gain; given that the market is expanding, where AMD loses sales to those organizations upgrading that are more resistant to change, just having the new hotness available to purchase in quantity makes them more attractive for new installations.



The longer Intel takes to get volume and performance back up, the more ground AMD will gain; I have an inkling that AMD won't gain as much as they rightly should given the quality of their products, but, I do expect them to have enough of a foothold to be able to maintain their presence and provide credible competition for the next decade at least.

Main issue for AMD isn't volume for datacentre, that's fine so far, it's the ecosystem and migration/software support which of course is rapidly shifting but it does take time. 

For Intel, aside from volume which is highly constrained so far, thermals and inefficiency in high core applications will really hurt them - water cooling is a prick to implement for a datacentre that is air cooled. I think that will be a real pivot point moving forward and that's even if they can get the volume they need too which they can't so far.

				Dan_D said:
			
		
	
	
		
		
			There are a ton of variables that impact a game's frame rates. We've seen memory speed and latency impact frame rates depending on a CPU's architecture. The PCI-Express bus has some impact, although its often a small one. However, in the era of 2600K's we saw chips on motherboards that multiplexed the PCIe lanes, handing switching and ""adding"" lanes while still being constricted to the same x16 lanes the CPU had to offer. The penalty was latency. Newer systems lack those as they've fallen out of fashion years ago. You can't correlate a Super Pi result by itself into a meaningful data point as it relates to any one game.



I have no interest in the games your talking about, but I'd wager that at a higher resolution, or on significantly more modern hardware and higher end graphics cards, the experience would be better. It pretty much always is. Sure, CPU's like the 2600K were remarkably relevant for an extremely long period of time relative to any preceding processors I can think of. Even with an older game, I still think your going to get better performance on a more modern processor. If not for the CPU itself, for all the other benefits a modern platform has to offer. Again, memory bandwidth, I/O bandwidth and so on all factor in.



IPC improved roughly 3% per generation after Sandy Bridge. You seem to forget that. Intel made stronger claims of anywhere from 7-11% a lot of times, but this did often require a ""best case scenario"" where additional instructions or specific workloads were required. But the IPC improvements were there even without that due to optimizations in cache design and other architectural improvements. The real reason why CPU's stagnated so long is because Intel concentrated on performance per watt and not raw performance. This allowed IPC gains to occur at lower clock speeds and with less power consumption as that benefits both mobile and server markets which are Intel's bread and butter.



We would see a 2-3% performance improvement in IPC, but lose 200MHz of clock speed each generation resulting in a wash for performance. The platform changes were also incremental. However, in case you hadn't noticed we are either at or beyond Sandy Bridge level clock speeds. Those used to clock to 5.0GHz and in some cases more. I've got a 9600K that can do 5.1GHz. The 9900K or 9900KF can achieve 5.0GHz pretty easily. 9900KS's can achieve upwards of 5.2GHz. Previously, I hadn't seen 5.1GHz or anything on that level since Intel's utterly craptastic Core i7 7740X. Since Skylake's release, Intel has done many process improvements to bring the clock speeds up. IPC hasn't changed much if at all since, but the clocks have only improved so now we have architectures that are significantly faster than Sandy Bridge with the same or better clock speeds. 



You also discount the other benefits an upgrade offers. Namely, the additional cores and threads improve overall system performance. You'll have more resources for background tasks and Windows optimizations for newer OS'es are in place for newer processors and platforms and the features they provide.



Look, I don't know what your trying to do here. Are you trying to convince us that there is no point in upgrading, or yourself? Spend the money, or don't. We don't really care. If all you do is play those old ass simulators then maybe its not worth it to you, but any notion that it isn't worth it based on Super Pi results is misguided at best.

All I really asked was a simple question:  I have this game here that when it is CPU limited changes in performance track this common benchmark.  When I look up scores for this common benchmark on the latest CPUs, the scores aren't really any better that what I've got.  Is this what I should expect?  I asked nothing about other upgrade advice, I was curious about this one thing, that's all.  I haven't discounted the other benefits, I haven't said anything about them because I don't care about them.  I haven't suggested that anybody else not upgrade.



Don't need the Intel sales pitch for features I'm not looking for, just a simple, direct answer to the question.   I really don't mean to threaten your security, but that response quoted above makes me think I hit a raw nerve.  I mean all of that, because I asked:






	
	
		
		
			Is it really that hard for you to believe that one game engine could see the same performance deltas between CPU clock speeds and X86 architectures when one program is that game engine while CPU limited and the other a benchmark of CPU throughput? Especially for a game you're very likely not familiar with? Really??? Can't *ever* happen?!??!

			Real quick, I wanted to address this point since I test CPU's with high end graphics cards at both low and high resolutions literally all the time for reviews. While keeping AA off would make the game more CPU limited, if you are truly held back by a CPU, this will be evident at higher resolutions as well. I've done the tests and games like Ghost Recon Breakpoint and Destiny 2 run substantially worse in some configurations using a high end graphics card, at both 1920x1080 and 3840x2160 with different CPU's.

Patience grasshopper, that is only a starting point.  I have been tuning this game for a very long time, what works is tuning the CPU w/o GPU limits, cranking up the resolution and anti-aliasing, then tweaking a thing here and there.   The most difficult part is finding the parts of the game that really load up either the CPU or GPU as it can max out both at different times.



With Keljian's offer, we have the potential to find out. 



I'm genuinely curious and willing to let the chips fall where they may.  Are you?

It's okay. It's still years behind Ice Lake.







This is mostly down to debugging Zen / Zen+, and upon implementing chiplets and 7nm, being able to afford copious amounts of cache to cover for the disadvantages of their architecture.







This is really a stroke of luck. TSMC is a coin flip away from fumbling a process family; they're famous for it, and it's bitten their customers in the ass before. AMD having something worth making and a fab to make it at really is a coincidence.







Intel's fabs have caused all kinds of trouble, and given their history, a four-year slip really is 'lucky' for AMD. Had Intel's fabs not slipped, Zen would have looked a lot like Bulldozer on release. Zen 2 would be just 'okay'.

Since most people are likely executing this off an NVMe drive, I don't think that matters. Of course, that negatively impacts you because your running a 2600K and won't have access to bootable NVMe drives on that platform.

		Click to expand...
	
No, I don't think it works that way. There are a ton of variables that impact a game's frame rates. We've seen memory speed and latency impact frame rates depending on a CPU's architecture. The PCI-Express bus has some impact, although its often a small one. However, in the era of 2600K's we saw chips on motherboards that multiplexed the PCIe lanes, handing switching and ""adding"" lanes while still being constricted to the same x16 lanes the CPU had to offer. The penalty was latency. Newer systems lack those as they've fallen out of fashion years ago. You can't correlate a Super Pi result by itself into a meaningful data point as it relates to any one game.



I have no interest in the games your talking about, but I'd wager that at a higher resolution, or on significantly more modern hardware and higher end graphics cards, the experience would be better. It pretty much always is. Sure, CPU's like the 2600K were remarkably relevant for an extremely long period of time relative to any preceding processors I can think of. Even with an older game, I still think your going to get better performance on a more modern processor. If not for the CPU itself, for all the other benefits a modern platform has to offer. Again, memory bandwidth, I/O bandwidth and so on all factor in.



IPC improved roughly 3% per generation after Sandy Bridge. You seem to forget that. Intel made stronger claims of anywhere from 7-11% a lot of times, but this did often require a ""best case scenario"" where additional instructions or specific workloads were required. But the IPC improvements were there even without that due to optimizations in cache design and other architectural improvements. The real reason why CPU's stagnated so long is because Intel concentrated on performance per watt and not raw performance. This allowed IPC gains to occur at lower clock speeds and with less power consumption as that benefits both mobile and server markets which are Intel's bread and butter.



We would see a 2-3% performance improvement in IPC, but lose 200MHz of clock speed each generation resulting in a wash for performance. The platform changes were also incremental. However, in case you hadn't noticed we are either at or beyond Sandy Bridge level clock speeds. Those used to clock to 5.0GHz and in some cases more. I've got a 9600K that can do 5.1GHz. The 9900K or 9900KF can achieve 5.0GHz pretty easily. 9900KS's can achieve upwards of 5.2GHz. Previously, I hadn't seen 5.1GHz or anything on that level since Intel's utterly craptastic Core i7 7740X. Since Skylake's release, Intel has done many process improvements to bring the clock speeds up. IPC hasn't changed much if at all since, but the clocks have only improved so now we have architectures that are significantly faster than Sandy Bridge with the same or better clock speeds. 



You also discount the other benefits an upgrade offers. Namely, the additional cores and threads improve overall system performance. You'll have more resources for background tasks and Windows optimizations for newer OS'es are in place for newer processors and platforms and the features they provide.



Look, I don't know what your trying to do here. Are you trying to convince us that there is no point in upgrading, or yourself? Spend the money, or don't. We don't really care. If all you do is play those old ass simulators then maybe its not worth it to you, but any notion that it isn't worth it based on Super Pi results is misguided at best. You are misinformed if you think that stupid benchmark has anything in common with a game engine, even an old one.

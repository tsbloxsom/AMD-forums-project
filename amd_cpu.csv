			Thanks, folks, for the input.



I guess, on balance, the most difficult part of all this is the realization that so many players out there are taking the opportunity to hoodwink buyers into believing they're getting prime parts.  As a crook, there's really nothing to cleaning up an old, scrapped processor with a little alcohol and passing it off to some hapless soul.  However, haste and sloppiness seems to tip the hand here -- with traces of aged heat sink compound and sticker residue -- along with a side of bent pins here and there.  Integrity, anyone?!?



FWIW, safety definitely plays a part in the reasoning behind keeping this old equipment alive.  Value, too: Over 30K hours on the old Turion and still counting!  So, it looks like I'll be taking a gander at the higher-end obsolete semiconductor world to see what might be about; and I'll come on back with anything noteworthy to share 



Meantime, I believe resourcefulness will be the word for the day; as I'll also be keeping an eye peeled here-and-there for something which is verifiably NOS and bound by a robust return policy.



Thanks again...

dude it's time to move on from turion.  i don't see how you can stomach using one.  my grandparents have one and last fall i was over there i told them i couldn't work on it anymore.  Just trying to get it to finish booting and start a web browser took about 10 min.  na.  turion's are trash these days.  pieced them together a desktop, w/ a mix of new and old parts, for christmas which worked out anyway because i just finished my Zen 2 system.



you can still get by with a x4 or x6 phenom II for web browsing and stuff though.  they still work great for that.  it just wont be a laptop.   heck i wouldn't worry too much about used processor's tho, they normally don't go bad.  as long as it make's it to you in one piece."

Hmm, according to some info on Google, appears this board doesn't have C'n'Q options like some other boards have. It's weird that the CPU isn't dropping further than 2500 MHz unless there's some background task running preventing it from idling down further.



And yeah, it really doesn't matter what type of fan you use, that aluminum slug can't pull heat out of the CPU efficiently enough to get temps any lower. I mean you could go crazy and try slapping a 8000 RPM delta fan on it, but you'd be driven insane from the jet engine noise."

New here and new to Ryzen. I just bought a 3700X knowing it already had bent pins all pins are straitened now. I was told there were no broken pins when I bought it. I don't believe the person who sold it to me was too tech savvy because they refused undertake the repair themselves. I got all the pins almost all the way good and was doing finishing touches and then realized that a pin was completely missing. I have looked and can't find if its a critical pin or not. I don't want to stick it in my kids brand PC we just built 3 days ago and risk damaging it if something were to  go wrong so it hasn't been tested yet. I just figured I would ask for a few pointers and see if anyone knows a pin out yet.

Why is it $400?  Get a b450 for $80 and throw $75 (16gb) worth of ram at it....

120+80+75 = $275... That's about how much a 7700k costs used.  Are you pairing it with a high end x570 for a ryzen 3 CPU?

That said, his CPU and GPU are probably close enough matched that he won't get much without upgrading both.

			So does AMD. AMD has charged more than Intel at times when it could get away with it. AMD's current top end HEDT CPU is $4,000. Intel's only at a quarter of that. When the Core i9 10980XE paper launched, AMD's top end (at that time) 3970X was $2,000. It's entry into the HEDT space was already $400 more than the 10980XE. On the mainstream segment side, AMD's top offering is more than $200 more expensive than anything Intel has. Now, on the AMD side you get more performance than Intel offers in everything but gaming above and below the 10980XE. Even where Intel is competitive, it's often still more expensive. For example, the Ryzen 5 3400G is less expensive than the Core i5 9400K. The 9400K is a good deal better, APU vs. iGPU not withstanding, but you do pay more for it.

True, but today's prices aren't the same as yesterdays prices. Intel has not only dropped prices but IIRC, also expanded it's core counts in the mainstream segment since Zen 2's launch. In anything heavily threaded, you NEEDED an Intel HEDT to compete with AMD's mainstream."

			Zen + was 11% slower on average in gaming than the 9900k at 5ghz So you tell me whats possible. Intel can't reign forever.



That 11% number is from HF, Anand, Gamers Nexus, Pauls, youi name it ... it averages 11% slower in games on all those review sites together.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Which includes GPU limited tests, a game that is 90% GPU limited can make a CPU that is 50% faster perform only 5-10% better in a average FPS test.



Even if it is still slower it may be fast enough that it performs well enough for most to get above the required FPS in current games and at high res in most games this will make the GPU the bottlneck so that there is no visible difference between the fastest available CPU (whatever that may be) and one that is slower.



I believe AMD can beat Intel in single threaded performance in a program like Cinbench which doesn't care about memory latency or perhaps in games when sticking to Intels stock memory frequency of 2666 with a c16 kit.

But with both overclocked using high speed RAM kits unless AMD has made some massive improvements to the memory controller and it's latency it will probably still fall behind in any software that is badly threaded and sensitive to memory latency like games, photoshop, lightroom.



The main advantage Ryzen 2700X had over 1800X in games was it's 7.6% reduction in memory latency but at best AMD is still ~60ns vs ~37ns for Intel when both have overclocked b die.

So even if the core is faster than Intel if it spends time idle while it is waiting on data from the RAM to be fed into the cache it will end up slower.



This is why I was hoping they would use that gap on the CPU for a L4 Cache if they could use something with half the latency of the RAM and at least 256MB like Intel used on the 5775c then they would have a true competitor to Intel.

			Yeah I agree about the binning.  What voltage are you using for SoC/Vddr?  I am at 1.1V and 1.45V respectively, but that was to ensure stability first.  I haven't had time to try to lower them down due to cooling issues.



I went to reassemble my loop and something told me to check my CPU block.  Opened it up and it was full of crap.  Checked the tubing and it was as well.  I made the mistake of letting the loop sit with some water in it during my back surgery and we had some insane humidity with it regularly getting up to 70%+ indoors.  It's 68f and 71% as I type this with my AC set to 70F.



I had to order a new CPU block since I couldn't get it clean and all new tubing and have to flush my rads.  Never had a single issue with this stuff in the past until moving to the PNW and this darn rainforest.

I live in GA and its probably more humid than the pacific nw. If your indoor RH is 71% with the AC on your AC is probably too small for your house. You might want to put a dehumidifier in your computer room or upsize your central HVAC unit.



Im running a ton too large in my home and it gets my RH down to 35% when the outside can be 100%. My water pump is constantly running every 15 mins full tank under my AC unit downstairs.



Of course the house came with this oversized AC when I bought it so I am not talking as if I am an authority on it. Just what I have noticed with this really large unit I have."

			I've been an AMD fan for a long, long time.  My second computer was an AMD 386 DX 40.  For my personal gaming rigs after that, only 3 weren't AMD.  I had one Celeron, a Pentium 90MHz and a Cyrix 6x86 P166+.  After those it was back on AMD all the way through a Turddozer 8150.  I've had so, so many different AMD rigs, for other purposes as well.  After FX everything fell apart for AMD and I now have had 1 Sandy Bridge, 1 Ivy Bridge, 1 Sandy-E and now an Ivy-E.  My router and NAS builds were also mostly AMD up until the latest builds.



However my next build will be an AMD.  For me, there's no reason to stay on Intel for now.

			Impressive how well the 3300x does in all applications.

The 4/8 3300x edges out the 6/6 3500x while the 4/8 7700k slightly trails the 9400F despite the same clock advantage.

Looking for some advice to get started on stretching the legs of my 3700X. I have tried a few settings and tbh my best benchmarks for gaming have been with these simple settings: XMP enabled, and 1:1 DRAM freq and Fclk. Both are at 3533mhz/1767mhz. Good improvements over stock for sure.



Looking at HWinfo while I game, I notice all of my cores are hitting 4.4ghz at one point or another and peak temp under load is about 65c. Peak temp under prime95 load is about 69c. During R20, all cores are ~4.0ghz, with single core at 4350 to 4399mhz.



I am not sure how to interpret the Ryzen Master screen below, as it says both CCX 0 and 1 dies are 4400, and it favors C02 and C06. Does anyone have experience or a guide to also enable Ryzen Master, in addition to my current simple settings, in order to get higher boost clocks in 1-2 cores while gaming? Heat isnt an issue.



Best geekbench 5: 1279 single core, 9183 multi core

Best Cinebench R20: 498 single core, 4704 multi core

if it was turning off it's possible it's not completely stable or older bios issues so every time it fails the memory training on boot it resets(should attempt it 3 times before resetting to 2166). so you might want to keep an eye on that if you happen to notice it taking longer than normal to boot."

			This right here is exactly the reason I'm building my new PC with 32gb, since Skylines is also such a memory hog.



I all but gave up playing it with my i5 computer in my signature. I just got waaaay too much into modding and it slowed the game so damn much, haha.



So once I get that new PC in my signature built, I'll be very curious how well the game runs.
		
		Click to expand...
	
It plays WAY better on my 3900x compared to my 1700, the framerate is still identical, even with the GPU barely topping 30% use, so it's definitely an engine limitation.



Zooming in and out is faster, moving around no longer stutters, there's no delay when turning on one of the overlays (traffic, police, etx.)



My main city, for reference, is 150,000 people using every single square (removed the limit) and I have maybe a hundreds mods active - mostly QOL, I got rid of a bunch of the unique building mods because they simply slowed stuff down too much.



I totally get the need for RAM, part of why I also have as much as I do (48gb). Cities skylines + a 4k video simultaneously is a big ol system hog, and I usually watch something else while playing my city builders."

I would think you'd also get a pretty big boost if you have to render or convert video while doing your editing also.



That motherboard is ok.  Pretty much all of the X570 have a decent VRM configuration because they were designed with the higher core count CPUs in mind.  That particular board has a Realtek NIC and the lower quality onboard sound (if you use it).  I stepped up to the Prime X570-Pro as it has an Intel NIC and the better onboard sound (on sale it was maybe $20 more than that, but it was a good sale.  Retail is $70 more).



I don't think it would be too terribly hard to get a ""K"" Intel chip in the next month or so if you are diligent about watching for them.  Whether or not you'd get price gouged is another story.  Another option might be to pick up a used 8700k setup that gets to 5Ghz.  Might have better luck finding that over a 10600k or better for gaming.  In that $400-420 price bracket, the 3900x is still a compelling option competing against the 10700k/9900k."

Makes me glad to see these forums alive and well still after being away so long.



But after even MORE debating (some parts being out of stock or just not even out yet helps prevent impulse buys lol), I decided to stretch the legs on my X58 just a little bit longer until the release of Zen 3 / X670 mobos along with RDNA/Big Navi/Ampere releases.



It's actually been kinda fun dusting off my overclocking notes and giving the old rig some long overdue maintenance.  I noticed the temps were above normal on the CPU/GPU so I replaced their very old TIM which made an appreciable difference.  The downside is that my i7 930 is tired and showing obvious signs of degradation (temps are up 10c from their old baseline and it does NOT like the voltages I used to run her at), I had to drop my OC to 3.8 and find the lowest vcore I could for stability.



Then did some research on how else I could maximize what I have for as little money as possible.  So I went with a Xeon X5675 I got off ebay for about 30 bucks.  Hoping I get a good one and am able to hit 4.4 - 4.6ghz.  Got another 6 gigs of ram for about 40 bucks to fill out the slots and I'll be running 12gb (lol) total soon enough.



Will this run future AAA titles at max settings and 100+ fps? No.  Will it run the games of the last 5+ years at 1080p high/max settings at around 60fps give or take? It will and I'm ok with that.  That said, I am very excited to see what Zen 3 and the upcoming GPU launches will bring to the table.  Going further, I briefly thought about waiting for AM5/Ryzen 5000 but that seems like an eternity from now and my life can and probably will change drastically between now and then.



Im hoping my next WOW! moment in gaming/PC hardware will be jumping into 4k resolution max settings at a solid 60+ fps or perhaps even better high refresh 4k gaming? (my last one was playing an FPS across a triple monitor setup on a 480GTX SLI)   Maybe then I'll be in a position to put something really special (custom hard tube watercooling, monster 4k screen) together that can hopefully carry me another 10 years lol.

			I'm not defending Intel's actions. They have a tendency to replace their motherboards and chipsets far more than is actually necessary. However, there are positive things that result from that. The people that complain about changing motherboards are often the same people who come into the forum and make threads about replacing their CPU and not being able to flash it, or asking about AMD CPU compatibility, because its not as cut and dry as they thought it would be. These same people also find that there may be additional limitations of memory clocking or that their old budget boards don't support some of the features that the new CPU's do.



When we are talking about $150 to $200 motherboards, I generally couldn't care less about having to replace the board to get the best possible computing experience and the most out of my new processor. When you are talking about $600+ motherboards, then I think we are well into constant motherboard changes being an issue. Of course, the more expensive motherboards didn't make as many compromises in their designs and using a newer CPU with a high end motherboard that's a generation old often comes with fewer problems. The weird thing is that the people who buy the ultra-cheap motherboards tend to be the ones that don't want to replace their boards. The ones who have the $600+ motherboards are often the ones who will replace it each time there is a new chipset to get the latest features, the best memory clocks, and the best overclocking.



But when you change motherboards and chipsets each generation, you avoid the pitfalls of requiring an old CPU to even get the system to POST with a newer CPU. You avoid your BIOS ROM being to small to support a broad range of CPU's. You get up to date VRM designs and implementations that generally allow for better overclocking of modern CPU's. You also get the ability to clock RAM higher than you might on the older motherboards with those newer CPU's. Modern power savings features often don't work on legacy motherboards. The list of disadvantages goes on and on. Intel broadly avoids all that crap. If you match up the socket with the CPU you are normally good to go. Intel's had broad socket compatibility in the past and the same problems AMD's platform has were all very much present. It has also had artificially short life spans for chipsets and sockets and occasionally people have found enough evidence to call them out on that.



You pick your poison, but whether you were tired of buying new motherboards or not, there are plenty of valid reasons to go either direction. Personally, even with AMD's broad socket compatibility I opt for newer motherboards. I've even replaced the motherboard without replacing the CPU in order to gain access to newer platform features when there was something there I wanted. Of course, this was largely back when Intel's CPU's were stagnant and there was far more innovation on the motherboard side. These days CPU's are moving forward again on the AMD side, so it's largely had reasons to upgrade each generation while Intel hasn't.

AMD is doing pretty darn well, but a lot of people are saying: ""They're only being ""nice"" while they're second. The moment they surpass Intel, or even Nvidia, that's when they go rotten and get greedy.""



Will their innovation stop?

Will they stagnate?

Will they start instituting weird backdoors?

Will they become unfriendly towards the FOSS community?

Will their prices go orbital if they ever gain control of the market?



Or will they stay true to benevolence, intelligence, innovation, and good value for the people?

This gets you pseudo-close to MRSP...maybe a $50 premium depending on what you value the motherboard at.  Keep in mind that, in the unlikely event you need RMA service, you would have to RMA (the CPU) through Supermicro, since it's a combo - and you 'only' get a 1-year warranty.  You'll also want the latest BIOS update for that motherboard because it fixes quite a few nuances.



All of that said, the 7702p workstation I built (512GB of 2666 MHz registered ECC in 8-channel config in addition to the 64-core CPU) is rock solid and is a real workhorse.

It's not HWMonitor. It's Open Hardware Monitor. Your CPU should not be running so high clocks all the time.

Yeah, if the 3300x was in stock I would have impulse bought one already.... Now that my impulse has passed (couldn't find stock and motherboards were almost impossible to find as well) I'll probably wait to see what makes the most sense .

I preordered my 3300X from BHPhoto on May 11th... The estimated ship date has moved a couple of times and is now Jun 26, 2020... I would cancel, but they had a brief period where you could preorder for $110 + tax.  



These paper launches from AMD are driving me nuts.  And it's even more frustrating that these CPUs are available in Europe and Canada.  AMD is US-based, and we invented the Internet.... So I don't get why they would not launch here first. It's not like Canada is closer to Taiwan where TSMC is.

			but you are testing 9900k,10900k, and 3900X those are all top of the line procs!   you can't say procs dont' make a difference what about 4930k or 2600k or a FX-6300 in the mix if the processor doesn't matter.  Plus you are most likely testing games that were coded to run on an Xbox or PS4 where the game engine is designed to run on jaguar cores anyway.   then you're saying well the biggest difference was minimum frames.  yeah  because the games prob felt like they were stuttering and frametimes were all over the place especially when lots of stuff was going on at the same time.  Wait till some of the next gen games drop and start telling me your little puny intel quad is gonna keep up with the big boys.   Really kinda just upsets me to see people recommending that others to get bottom end, minimum spec processors for gaming rigs which in turn will turn people off of PC gaming in the future becuase their rigs run like shit when new games come out.   I mean yeah if all you want to do is play counterstrike: source.  then yeah  go ahead and build you an I7 920 rig and be happy.   but look think about you're posting at?..  ..this is [H]ard OCP son!   GO [H]ard or GO {h}ome.  we ain't about a bunch of panzy @$$ pentiums round here!   and think about it, if you build a system with a solid enough backbone, you can always keep it going a few years and just upgrade the GPU instead of having to build a whole new rig.  so keep that in mind too.



p.s.  funny the guy w/ the 10900k is telling everyone else to get a weaker proc.  thats some sewer tactics, bro.



and kids.  really if you really want to make a system last and you are on a budget...  you don't need 4K on a little dinky monitor that's sitting 3ft from your face...   but that's a whole nother topic.  ...but if you got a few grand to blow on a new rig every year, more power to ya.  just trying to look out for the working man.

Are you kidding me? Did you even read what I wrote? I am the one that said processors matter at 4K when someone else said they didn't. I gave examples as well. My review with data backs up that claim. I did agree that in certain cases CPU differences weren't massive at 4K, but again, I pointed out the difference between a title that's not entirely GPU limited at 4K and one that was. I also said that if you only have a limited budget, you are better off putting that money into the GPU over the CPU. Even so, I stated very clearly that a processor was still important and that if you can afford a top end processor that it would be worth having.



And if you aren't at 4K or at least close to it (3440x1440 as an example) you will be at more CPU dependent resolutions. If your aiming for higher refresh rates, then a higher end CPU is what you need.



Let me be clear. I reviewed a Core i9-10900K. I have one on the test bench for reviewing motherboards and CPU's. I never said I was running one in my own system. I also never told anyone to buy a weaker processor. I don't know where you got that from. Clearly, you either didn't read my post or didn't understand it. Please, don't talk to me about where we are posting or being [H]ard. I'm well aware as I have over 50,000 posts here and wrote reviews for HardOCP for 15 years. My personal machines are also built with little regard for price/performance ratio.

			I'd think something is wrong with the C-States in the firmware, like they're not turned on. Or AMD Cool'n'Quiet isn't enabled if the lowest clock you're getting is 2500 MHz.



You may want to check for newer firmware versions for that motherboard. I have that same ASUS board in use as a router and server, and earlier firmware versions did have weird issues.
		
		Click to expand...
	
actually the 2500 is normal because hwinfo can only see down to the minimum multiplier in the bios which is what the api reports and that is 25x for that board(some of the earlier bios could go down to 20x and anywhere between those two numbers), the cpu it's self can step down all the way to .25x which only ryzen master could see until the recent beta version of hwinfo64 was released(the one with the offset voltage detection)."

And even then I had to wait weeks for it to be in stock with the scalpers, and an additional 2 days for it to be in stock with the actual retailer itself (didn't want to buy from a scalper).  Just after buying, it went out of stock, so I must've gotten the last one.  It's due to arrive a couple days from now.  I plan on doing video editing, and I'm sure the 3900x will be plenty for what I need to do.

		Click to expand...
	
Nah.  I spent $400 on the board for my gaming system (mATX 6600k) when I bought it; it does what I bought it for the same as it did on the first day I built it.  Still has the same GTX 1080 I bought it for, although I'm debating on swapping to a 2080TI and moving the 1080 to the wife's system (she has a 1060).  The only reason I'm thinking about upgrading now is that I spent a month tracking down stability problems and was about to swap everything out, and like the idea of adding more storage capabilities and the like - otherwise I wouldn't be paying attention at all right now.  I live in the server world day-to-day, not consumer.  



I buy for what it does, not what it ~could~ do.  I don't upgrade CPUs once a system is built - the board and CPU live and die together forever.  Haven't done CPU upgrades since Athlon64 -> X2 on 939, would rather buy a complete system that is designed from the start to work together, and then use that till it won't do what I need it to do anymore.   It's not like the board stops working, or the processor isn't just as fast as it was the day I bought it - it's that the rest of the world gets better too.  I buy for a need or a use, and then use it.  If this system hadn't thrown issues, I'd be using it till 2022 or so.  



I've been doing this since the 286 days.  There's always something new on the horizon, and it's always coming ""soon"" - you can wait forever, or buy right when they come out and play the ""oh fun bugs"" game.  I buy when it seems right to buy, and then use the living daylights out of it till it's useless.  I don't do upgrades anymore, except GPUs.  Once built, it stays together unless something dies.  I used to swap parts every year, now things tend to be good enough to last a long time.  That's GOOD, especially for me - things are useful for a LONG time.  Remember when it was less than 2 years between the 100mhz Pentium and the 233?  I do.  Sucked balls.

			That doesn't have anything to do with real world MBs today. $200 motherboards will run a 3900x the same as a $300 board, the exact same as a ripoff $700 CH8. Hell the $280 Strix-E has the same vrms, same ROG bios for less than half the cost. You need to get real man, you are suggesting an EPEEN setup. Do whatever you want, its your money. But don't come on suggesting you have to overpay for the same thing just because of poor rationalizing. The x370 boards are known to be missing future support because they are damn old. C'mon man...
		
		Click to expand...
	
And in two years, X570 boards will be damn old.  x670 will be damned old 2 years after it comes out - are you going to complain if you have to upgrade motherboards for Zen 4?  My Sandy Bridge system lasted me 4 generations, sold that one.  Bulldozer lasted me till Ryzen as a workstation, now runs as my wife's gaming system (she'll get my 1700 system, I'll move the Bulldozer to a NAS in my lab until it lights on fire, and then I'll celebrate - that system was SHIT).    Before that, I had a Phenom - it's my main Plex server now, and needs an upgrade, which will likely come from the gaming system when it gets rebuilt next year.  Before that was a random pre-built I got on super sale.  Can't even remember what it was.  

  

That's what happens.  The Formula has twice the USB ports, back plate, better cooling, etc.  You get something for that cash - value there is determined by the buyer, of course, but for me that stuff is worth it (especially the USB ports, which I tend to feed a LOT of things).  And there's a higher chance for a BIOS update on a higher-end board 4 years from now to fix an issue than there is on a cheaper one.  EG:  My 370 Carbon Pro Gaming got 4 updates total.  The same 370 chipset on their high-end board got 8.  And is still getting updates.  Not for gaming uses, necessarily, but for whatever comes up.  Of course, my 990FX-UDA3 got 40 updates, but that's because it was absolute garbage.  They ended on the 12th or so revision of that board    



You have valid points, they just don't fit how ~I~ use systems.  I think of them almost like consoles that have swappable GPUs.  And a #%@!% ton of storage for things.  Then they move on to a second use case, and finally into the lab, where they help feed various bits and pieces and the [H] DCC group until they die.  Sell of the parts that are left or put them in spares, and move on."

			IANAG (Geologist) but after a quick search on ArcGIS Pro's accelleration capabilities it seems like it's restricted to Nvidia cards only and no OpenCL support (it's so great when companies give open standards the finger - I'm looking at you too, Matlab! /s)

https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/gpu-processing-with-spatial-analyst.htm

and it can use at a maximum 32 threads per CPU

https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/geostatistical-analyst/parallel-processing-with-multiple-cpus.htm



However, because you say that it's for your studies, I'm assuming that you're not throwing 150+TB of information through it? If you want to speed up this program specifically, you might want to evaluate the potential return on investment for your future for grabbing a 16- or 32-core CPU (dunno if hyperthreading will be a help or a hinderance) or an Nvidia GPU vs AMD GPU. I think the X5670 should serve you well for your studies at the very least. What are you currently studying, masters?



Also, consider 64GB of RAM if you're going to be doing more than gaming. I doubled my RAM to 32GB a year or so ago thinking that it's complete overkill and that I'm wasting my money. Nope! It's turned out SUPER useful.  If you REALLY want it to carry you 10+ years, be sure to leave some open RAM slots so that upgrading to 128GB will be cheaper down the line. This bit me with my E6750's mobo with only two DIMM slots. My current i7-6700 mobo has 4x RAM slots, I have 2x 16GB modules for this exact reason.



I suppose you already know this, but try and get a really good top GPU card if you want it to last 10+years.



Lastly, are you SURE that your PSU is good? You really don't want your PSU popping your shiny new bags of awesome. Even if you take a 3950X at 250W peak (it's really max 150W) plus, say, a rather exaggerated 500W peak for your next-gen GFX card (a factory OC'd 2080 Ti draws around 335W max,) a good Platinum 750W PSU costs about USD150.





You and me both, mate...





Edit:

Does ArcGIS Pro support AVX512 (currently Intel only) accelleration and does it perform significantly better with AVX512 as opposed to AVX2? If so and if it is important enough to you, navigating the mess that is AVX512 support might warrant consideration.

Great information! Thanks for pulling up the ArcGIS Pro hardware info regarding cores and GPU processing (now I wonder if the software can take advantage of an Nvidia SLI setup on a desktop for Spatial Analysis duties).



Concerning the upgrade, I wanted to factor in the gains that software (gaming, productivity etc) has been making over the last few years that finally take advantage of more cores/threads.  Which is why I had a 3950x at the top of my list but it's difficult for me to justify the additional cost of a Threadripper system for home use (unless I decide to go secondhand) considering I don't even have a job in the GIS field yet and won't for some time (finishing my Bachelors in Geography focusing on Geographic Information Systems).  Sadly, COVID has made things dramatically worse in terms of schooling and job outlook which was THE deciding factor in deciding to hold off on an upgrade today and just hold the line another year.



Good point about the RAM.  Using my current setup as a clear example, 6GB was perfectly adequate in 2010 when this was built, however after diving back into the state of computer hardware  in 2020, I found myself at or below minimum spec even for software that dates back several years!   Thankfully it was a relatively easy (and cheap) fix thanks to so many people holding onto their X58 platforms to this day.  For the next build I think I'll start with a 64GB base to leave headroom for 128 several years down the line.



My current PSU has driven dual 480 GTX's to the power hungry R9 series it still has today, all without ever skipping a beat and still runs like a champ today.  So I don't doubt that its up to the task of upgrades in the near future but at this point considering how old it is I'd rather pickup a newer, more powerful and more efficient PSU design to carry me the  next 10 years.



So now it seems like my next build will be entirely new from the ground up which will likely consist of the last generation of AMD CPU's utilizing the AM4 socket (perhaps an updated more cores/threads version of the 3950x), a top end GPU (or two) from the Big Navi/Ampere releases, 64GB of ram and the fastest/largest NVME drives I can get my hands on along with a nice 1600 watt platinum PSU and 1000D case from Corsair.  2021 cant come soon enough.

			I'm not even sure how anyone can be cranked about this.  Old motherboards are compatible with new processors...  Are we really complaining that the currently available super budget motherboards, cannot be upgraded to the next generation of unreleased processors?  I understand how it would be desirable to buy a new motherboard now with a longer upgrade path, but it does not make any sense for AMD to release such a thing that would immediately make all their existing budget inventory obsolete.

If the upgrade path is important to you, spend the extra $75 on a X570 motherboard.

I'm more excited about still being able to drop these chips into my old X370.

Sounds like the OP is doing video library stuff rather then live streaming.  I keep a video library and shoot for smallest file size with highest quality.  Software encoding does the best there, but also takes longer.  The hardware encoders specialize in speed at the cost of some quality and file size, ideal for live streaming. 



I haven't tried the latest nVidia encoder since I have a GTX 1660 and the latest one is only included with the RTX series, but at this point I get the best results for library stuff with software encoding which is CPU intensive.  Both AMD and Intel CPUs have hardware encoders, but they have the same pros and cons as the nVidia hardware encoder.  They say the nVidia encoder is the best one as far as hardware encoders go."

			Been running benchmarks and stress gaming for s few hours now.  Hit XMP, put the RAM at the previously stable 2800 and everything booted and ram perfectly.  Even did a prime 95 torture test - CPU is surprisingly staying around 60c, with prime 95 running the VRMs got a toasty 90c, but I haven't seen them go above 65c in literally any other scenario and it's usually staying around 50c.  In general temps are lower than my 1700, but considering I had to keep my 1700 at a constant 3.9ghz to be stable that kinda makes sense.



Biggest change thus far is I'm now mostly GPU limited in Planet Coaster, at 4k instead of a fluctuating 20fps I'm sitting around 40-45, I'm sure I can mess with more settings to get that higher.  Cities Skylines is still only about 25FPS, but it's a FAR more responsive 25fps, which is nice, but a little underwhelming.



Monster Hunter World is now basically a locked 60fps, even in super intense screen situations.  I honestly didn't think that I was CPU limited there, so a damn nice improvement.



I'll give Doom Eternal and some FPS a try later tonight, I know I was CPU limited at high refresh rates on a few.



The bad news is that putting my RAM over 3000 is an instant crash and bootloop till the motherboard hard resets itself.  Putting it at 2933 loads into windows but crashes under load.  Might be stuck at 2800.  So I'm guessing that's a motherboard limitation.  So be it.



Beat my previous best 3dmark score by nearly 1000 and finally broke 10k!



Alright.  More gaming to do, everything thus far has been with my side off, but I'll put the sides back on when I upgrade my cooler this weekend.   So far I'm happy.

Takes quite a bit of tuning to get memory to work better but it is possible. I took my 3200 ram that would only do 3000 to 3600 now, but that took some trial and error and I run all custom settings. Sounds like it's working good for you in the games you play."

			90c is hot but not overly so for a VRM. What ram do you have and what die it is (check with Typhoon Burner)? There are some dies that simply do not clock and your only hope is to tighten the timings as much as you can.

I'm running a mixed set of 48GB of G-Skill Ripjaw V.  2x 8GB sets of Samsung 3200 and 2x 16GB sticks of Sk. Hynix 3200

I don't have much hope tightening timings considering how wildly different the two sets are. I utilize all the ram so I really don't want to remove any sticks - so I'm pretty much stuck at a lower speed I expect.  Could I go out and get better RAM?  Yes.  Am I going to?  Probably not.  My goal with the 3900X upgrade was to make this AM4 platform last me till AM5.  Not bad for a cheap launch motherboard.



Now that the (ambient) temperature is warming up and i've done a lot more, my CPU idles at around 45c, it's gone as high as 75c during a stress test but it usually stays in the 55-65 range under normal load. (Which lately has been plex transcoding.) I'm hoping the new cooler will lower those when I install it after it arrives. Weirdly I can't really seem to push the CPU wattage over 100 watts in any scenario, no matter the temperature. Apparently I have hit 4.6ghz on a few cores, but i suspect that was only for seconds at a time. Usually things seem to stick in the 4.3ghz range, which for completely stock - I'm really happy with.

I finally have enough cpu power that transcoding isn't making ANY noticeable difference no matter anything else my computer is going.  I'm not gonna miss those stutters.

			Good thing the OP switched gears towards a different direction after he thought about his current usage situation. However, had he gone with your suggestion, then he would have substantially blown even that high of a budget because a TR4-socket motherboard by itself costs $600 while the 3960X by itself costs $1,300. That's already $1,900 just for the CPU and motherboard - and that does not include any RAM or GPU at all whatsoever, nor does it come with any SSD storage whatsoever. That leaves only $200 left, total,  for all three components combined. That's just plain pound-foolish, since he will NEVER get anything decent in terms of a GPU, RAM and storage all for $200 combined. In fact, he would have needed to budget another $2,000 just for those components to prevent a major bottleneck in that Threadripper system. Why spend $1,900 on a 3960X with motherboard alone, only to completely choke the entire build with only a GeForce GT 710 DDR3 and only 8 GB total of RAM and only a 128 GB SSD? Makes no sense at all right there.

He said he could push it to $3000, which is what I was referring to when saying if he's spending that much. Like him, I'll be reusing my case (PC-V2120) and AX1200i, and can easily get the rest of a 3960X setup for $3000, actually just bought a 2070 Super to replace the two GTX 670s this weekend."

I wonder if the 40 PCI-E lanes is really 20 PCI-E 4.0 lanes that have the bandwidth of 40 PCI-E 3.0 lanes?



That would still be double the I/O bandwidth of Ryzen2 but at the same time be less desirable than a Threadripper2 (64 PCI-E 3.0 lanes) let alone a PCI-E 4.0 Threadripper3.  It is also simpler for the sockets because the Ryzen's already have 20 lanes (although it is entirely possible AMD thought of that and left pins available in the original AM4 spec socket to add more PCI-E lanes).



Ryzen3 will probably still be dual-channel RAM so it would be another way to keep costs down (CPU and motherboard) and unlikely to challenge Threadripper2/3.  As a bonus it would be less likely to alienate early Threadripper adopters (who probably already feel burned by the Threadripper2).



Maybe AMD will be pulling an Intel Xeon with the PCI-E lanes, where different CPUs have different number of lanes even though they all fit in the same socket?  If AMD did that it would allow AMD to create a middle enthusiast level (below Threadripper but above the Ryzen2) and give buyers more options.  On the other hand some enthusiasts are unhappy that lower Xeons are crippled at the PCI-E lanes level, such a tactic by AMD may alienate the very buyers they are trying to attract.  Also it may make more sense for AMD to keep the lines simple as it reduces the number of SKUs (especially motherboard chipsets).  



Don't get me wrong, I want a big 16-core Ryzen3 with lots of I/O as I'm planning on replacing my home hypervisor and I would prefer to avoid the premiums you pay for Threadripper.  I just think AMD is smart enough to not bite the hand that feeds them now that they have a competitive architecture again - how many Threadripper buyers are sitting on their hands right now waiting for Ryzen3 to drop to see if a platform a third of the price of Threadripper would do the job?  If AMD doesn't give Threadripper buyers a real reason to buy Threadrippers they are not going to sell a lot of them."

Try enabling XMP profile for your ram if this is the case.

Ryzen's like memory bandwidth upwards of DDR4 3733MHz or DDR4 3800MHz. DDR4 3200MHz is really the standard you should shoot for at a minimum. And as the above post indicates, the Infinity Fabric and memory clocks are linked at a 1:1 ratio unless you go to DDR4 3800MHz or beyond. Memory bandwidth, when dropped that low could absolutely impact your frame rates. I'm not certain this is the only issue here but it's a damn good place to start."

			Well, I mean, I think AMD actually raised prices back to the release prices of Zen2.  I'm pretty sure the current pricing was in the form of official price cuts.  I doubt the ""official"" price of the 3900x is still $499.  I'm pretty sure I read that it was $420 now.



Once again, whether or not it is worth it is subjective.  I probably would just save the money with the non-XT chip.

I was talking about 3800xt vs 3800x, etc.  However, 1700x was $399, 2799x was $329 and 3700x was $329.  So prices have not gone up with zen2, they have remained the same, which is LOWER than zen (same as zen+).  The official price of the 3900x is still $499 on AMD's website (https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-3900x  7/18/2020).

That said, it IS available for less than that and that's still the case with this XT release.  So they are offering the XT for the SAME price and prices of the previous release have dropped slightly.  So, I guess you can consider it a price hike because prices have already dropped on previous model?  Kind of a grey area to me, but Intel RAISED the MSRP of the KS regardless of what the K was actually selling for."

			Thing is the new Ryzen should match or maybe even exceed Intel's latest CPUs in single thread performance while offering more cores and much lower thermals.

Yeah, if you’re running all threads full out all the time and are overclocked without speedshift and adaptive voltage. But, you typically are not.



As mentioned many times my 9900k uses 50w peak while playing games, at 5ghz all cores, with cache at 4.7. Temps are barely above 50C and fans are barely ticking over.



Unless I got super lucky and won the silicon lottery (unlikely), you must be doing something wrong to always hit high temps.

Also if AMD is wanting to reboot the line up for 12nm then why not just say Ryzen 5 1650 as it would cover all the changes that it offers more .



Also I bought one as I want to pair it with RX 570 as the Hardware Unbox review of the 2600 vs 3600 showed that at 1080p Ultra with Polaris made no different if it was a 9900k pushing Polaris as it was already bottle necked by video card.

my 2600x only goes down to 3000 but i always thought it was because i had min cpu freq at 75%.  lowering it to 50% didnt change at all. guessing thats normal then.  maybe it is all down to the heatsink then. technically it is within amds acceptable range. when you can, moving up to a better tower cooler would be a good idea. something like the 212 or even one of these is a steal if you dont mind the color: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075CXTKWC/?tag=arctic07-20&th=1"

			First off, there isn't a 1:1 core relationship between VM's and physical resources. The architecture allows you to over commit resources and still perform adequately. So, a 3950X doesn't just do one VM more than a 3900X because you gave that one VM 4 cores to work with. That's just not how it works. Also, when it comes to performance, it isn't as though you get 4 cores and that's it. The 3950X does boost slightly higher than the 3900X and therefore, does perform a little better in single-threaded applications.



Also, the 3950X isn't double the price of a 3900X. The 3950X can be had for $699.99 at Microcenter and about $430-$450 on the 3900X if you shop around. Even at $749.99, the 3950X still isn't double the price of the 3900X. It's not super far off, but if you were seriously entertaining buying a Threadripper 3960X, then that really shouldn't make any difference. There is nothing you've described in your use case that suggests you would benefit from the added memory bandwidth, extra PCIe lanes, or additional CPU cores.



Your costs for the motherboard may be similar, but the CPU is twice as much as a 3950X. RAM isn't exactly the same either. You need four memory modules instead of two. That's not huge by itself, but it adds up. The power requirements and heat dissipation needs of a 3960X are also greater. These should be factored in as well. AIO's on Threadripper are basically varying levels of shit and an air cooler on them isn't really ideal either.

I'm probably more familiar with virtualization than anyone on this board, given where I work   My requirements are not normal VMs for some of what I do - I'm simulating specific hardware in some cases, including stuff that's not available to the public (beta software releases, beta hardware, NVDIMM, NVMeOF, etc).  That part requires core counts (one of the workloads effectively locks 6 cores to it - as that's what the hardware has if you install it bare metal, and it sets a 100% reservation).  I don't need to run those odd balls often, but I do need to from time to time - and they don't actually play well being run in ESXi (Type-2 on NVMe is more effective, with source data stored on NFS).  



Let me put it this way - my current plan is to dedicate an entire 2TB NVMe drive to VMs - plus the 10TB NAS I have sitting here.  There's a second NAS for my normal stuff.    The point on TR is absolutely spot on though - I probably don't need the extra lanes or memory bandwidth, since this is a simulation, but the extra cores MAY be useful.  



Pricing on the 3950 X was showing $700, but I found the 3900 for $380 with motherboard bundles, which is what I used for those calculations.  The 3960 was $1200 with bundle (total bundle).  Always planned on running 4 modules - I'm at 32G now, and this would get 64 for certain (which I'm digging into for compatibility) if not 128.  I've got 128G of ECC sitting around here somewhere, but I'm still researching how that would even play with Ryzen OR ThreadRipper, and there's a pair of 2690 V4s that I had it slated for instead if I can ever find a motherboard I like for those (going back into the Lab, I have need for that system).  At a minimum, the VMs in question ~require~ 24G of RAM (leaves me with 8 free right now), but those only run once or so a month.  The rest of the time it's more normal stuff.  



Work and home blend a bit for me, but I don't get paid for what I do directly on this system - it leads to what I DO get paid on though.  



Heat - I thought the AIOs for TR had gotten better by now?  The top-end corsair / etc aren't good enough?"

			Gamers Nexus did a nice comparison of Zen through the ages to compare gaming performance at 1080p to see where the real increases are.

They did a great job and I recommend the watch. I was hoping they would throw in a few 4K's to round it out, but they did not as it was all about isolating the CPU.

I am searching for some benches that do such a comparison as I want to know how the different generations compare with VR type resolutions.

When I game in VR my RT-VR stats show I am always bound by my GPU. Never CPU. I know it is somewhat of a two way street in that the CPU helps the GPU, but by how much and would like to know when this cut off is.

If anyone has a link to anything in these regards I would be appreciative.

It depends on the game.



Most VR games are relatively simple games (in terms of the game logic), and thus can hit the required 90 FPS on even a modest CPU.  There are games where this is not the case, however.  DCS World is one such game, where it's very CPU heavy, and even with a 9900K, it sometimes struggles to manage 90 FPS because it's CPU bound."

I downgraded to the Prime-X570 Pro board and it doesn't feel any different (other than saving myself about $150).  I think a good middle ground is that Strix-E board as it is 97% of the CH8 but $299 instead of $379 (or whatever they go for now).



As for TR, if you have to think about whether or not you'd use it to its fullest advantage, you're better off saving money and not buying it, IMO.

			Problem is glaringly obvious, the cooler. Low profile cheap aluminum only blow down coolers are junk, you're not going to ever get good temps with them. I'll give AMD credit for using a slightly better fan than Intel, but the light and cheap extruded aluminum is still the limiting factor.



Quite literally any cooler with heatpipes will be better than that cooler, whether it be blowdown or tower. My go to cooler is a Hyper 212 plus or evo, but other coolers like the Deep Cool GAMMAXX 400, Zalman CNPS5X and Cooler Master Hyper TX3 are fine too.
		
		Click to expand...
	
The stock Ryzen coolers are more than capable of handling a 2600. The problem seems more likely tied to voltage control. I would say disable MCE in your BIOS to start. 



Another thing to note here: idle temps are really not that important whatsoever. Pay more attention to temps under load. Your temps under load are abnormally high, closer to what one would expect from a gaming laptop. Of course you can buy a new cooler, but that misses the point!"

I don't know, 1600af is good if you plan to OC I guess, but the 3300x would probably still beat it in gaming and be pretty on par with mutlithreads (even with less cores).  @$85 shipped the 1600AF was a great budget CPU, at $100+ it's a hard sell.  Check around on benchmarks, 3300x seems to win by like 20% in gaming (just my rough guess after seeing a few charts may be more or less).  It also wins in a good amount of other things like audio encoding zip compressor, browser speeds etc.

  I would suggest finding benchmarks for what you use and then make the decision if the price difference is worth it.  Right now, 1600AF are @$150... Absolutely horrible deal.  Can get a 3600 for $20 more."

			Rough numbers:

4.2ghz on the 3900x

2.8ghz on the x5660s



50% faster clock on the 3900x



If the x5660s were 50% faster they would do it in 54 minutes.. interesting
		
		Click to expand...
	
That's not how that works...

The x5660s would have to be 100% faster (twice as fast) to do it in 54min... 54mins is roughly half of 1hr49min.



If the x5660s were running 50% faster (4.2GHz) they would get it done 50% faster not 100% faster.

x5660 @ 2.8GHz=107min or 1hr49min

x5660 @ 4.2GHz=71min or 1hr11min



your math = 107 * 0.50 = 53.5min

correct math = 107 / 1.50 = 71min     (4.2GHz is 150% of 2.8GHz  or 1.50x of 2.8GHz or 50% faster than 2.8GHz)



That makes it even more impressive!

the 3900x has about a 50% IPC lead on the x5660



Math!

Maybe in cinbench but Intel has a big advantage in games due to there sensitivity to memory latency unless your comparing Intel with 2666c16 vs AMD 2933c14.



@4GHz with 3200c14 RAM Intel is up to 10-15% faster in these tests but there is no way of knowing how GPU limited they are.

I haven't used AMD since Opteron 170 and before that a Duron 650 upgraded to Athlon XP2000.

But I am looking forward to pairing A new Ryzen CPU with my Radeon VII and seeing how it compares to my 6700K with some heavily overclocked b die.

I managed to nab 2 of them with the $19.99 lock-in and $100 purchase each.  Shipping to Australia was unfortunately $100 but that's what I get for living in super-sized alcatraz in the middle of the pacific.



I bought one for my 3900x and the other for my 8700k. 



I am super keen for testing them and posting the temps and setup here, I have also updated my cases to the cooler master h500m (using NH-D15 in it on the 3900x) and the Phanteks p600s eclipse for the 8700k rig because of the nice offset for my 360mm AIO in push/pull.



As soon as I get the units I will do my testing in as many thermal tests as I can (no infrared imaging though).  Hoping the thinned-down variant performs as well as the engineering sample although it will be a much smaller IHS so I have my fears.

if they did that then they'd have to admit it's a problem, so that would never happen.. either way it's completely safe pulling the cpu out of the socket with the heatsink. where the problems happen is when people panic and attempt to put the cpu back in the socket with it on the heatsink still or don't look at the bottom of the heatsink to see the cpu's there. my hope though is that with am5 they end up using some form of the TR socket/locking mechanism."

I wouldn't hold out if you want a new computer now. I think if your current rig were a little more modern, it might make sense to wait and see what Ryzen 4000 and RTX 3000 bring to the table, but we don't even have model numbers yet, much less a firm release date. Based on Ryzen 3000 and RTX 2000 releases, availability will be spotty and prices will be high the first few months. Factor in uncertainly with supply chains due to COVID, and it could very likely be 2021 before those parts are widely available.

Looks like a fast 4c8t cpu can still get it done for a while longer yet.  For me these are interesting for general computing use, HTPC, upgrading an already ultra budget AM4 board with a first gen Ryzen quad, or setting up a new system on AM4 with the mind to eventually move to the 3900x or 3959x.



Still , personally, I feel that a 6c12t cpu is really the budget sweet spot and will last longer. These R3s are punchy and interesting but I’m not feeling it at even $120.

Well, after the consoles come out games/engines (especially those migrated from console) will tend to be more friendly towards cores.  Of course there is only so much you can thread in a game, so point of diminishing returns.  4/8 works really well, especially when it's a single CCX with reduced latency.  This is why it has so much better performance than the 3100 and can hang or beat the 3600 in lots of cases.  But it still gets beat by in heavily threaded and by 3600x and higher due to lack of cores.  This isn't bad, it's only $120 CPU and is more than enough for most normal usages.  If building a cheap box for a limited budget but they want to play some games, this is a pretty good middle ground deal.  Would make a great CPU for my daughter's PCs for example (heck, it easily beats my current 1600 in pretty much everything, but it'd be more of a sidegrade for me).  May be give my MB to my daughter with a 3300x, get a used b350 atx to replace my aging server with my 1600 where the extra cores help.  Dunno yet, waiting for b550's and more zen3 info to see if I can reuse my b450 or not."

yeah i've seen the video and sure if you're doing it purely for benchmarking which is all buildzoid cares about then yeah those are the best options, but all you lose is a few ns of latency which you'll honestly never notice outside of benchmarks. but he also did a video before that showing 4x16GB at 4800mhz which i always find funny so why do it and then tell people not to do it... either way it's been brought up many times on his streams and his only argument for it is that latency is slightly worse even though he'll overexaggurate it as it being terrible but i think it's something like 67ns vs 72ns if you run 4x16GB vs 2x16."

No he doesnt review an item or a specific. He rants on and on about this and that and most of it is not even related. Truth be told I am not even going to blame him., Youtube has recently changed the requirements of content providers. In order to be monetized you need to have enough content length to justify X amount of ads to be played in your video.



All of the hardware reviewers went from Straight to the Point to having to meet this ridiculous criteria. But it doesnt nullify my right to complain at how stupid it (algorithm) has gotten and how long and arduous these videos are. The old Gamers Nexus was spot on. They said what mattered and moved on.



Edit*



Also who is this content for anymore? Beginners? Advanced? Steve and crew will go from saying...



On LN2 @ X volts we hit Y using LLC % Q etc.... to all of the sudden, ""To apply thermal paste, you need to squeeze the tube"" or ""this is a screwdriver and you use it to screw in these screws right here"" back to another video sharing a dissertation about quantum computing and its advanced Artificial intelligence hashing out proofs of boolean Pythagorean triples theorem back to ""This is a gpu, and you install it in this here slot"".



Needless to say I still stay sub'd but I just skip all the talk unless it interest me. But its not catchy content anymore like it used to be.

2600 and a b450 Tomahawk.

There's not much to be concerned about Ryzen 4xxx as fast as I'm concerned.

Told the kid that if he needs a future upgrade he should go get a job.  I told him not to waste $ on 10-20 more fps, maybe upcore *hint* if he's making $ creating something.



I'm surprised no one ever talks about the limited storage options with b450 tomahawks.  1xnvme and 2xsata or 4xsata.  Granted I see the gaming focus in the board, and I really like picking it up bc it feels like a quality pcb compared to the b450 junk I usually put together.



If more b450 boards had been storage downpspeced like the tomahawks, x570 would have been a clearer upgrade with respect to storage options.

Truth be told... I don't think we should give them a ""pass"" just because they're AMD.



I'm glad that they're competitive now though (but no pass).

I wasn't giving them a pass, I was saying Intel stagnated/dropped the ball while AMD moved forward dragging Intel with them.  And it's impressive a single not not even top end CPU can easily outperform 2 such expensive chips from the past.  Its like in 10 years from now do you expect a consumer chip to outperform dual EPYCs in heavily threaded work loads?  I sure hope so, but my hopes aren't too high that we'll see single 256 core consumer CPUs that aren't even top of the line."

HardOCP only lives on in forum form and the last AMD CPU I owned was a Clawhammer FX-53 that I cooled with a Koolance Exos (remember those?). So I find myself back in HardForum to get some advice/feedback on moving forward with a new build.  I can potentially push my budget up to $3000 should there be a very convincing reason to (one of the other things that has changed since I built this rig was getting married, so I can't go ham on parts like I used to lol).



I'm considering upgrading because of Coronavirus having (most of) us stay at home and finding that my ancient setup simply cannot keep up with most recently released games (the best I can do is Civ 6 and the recent HALO remasters) and also needing (wanting) a better optimized setup to run the programs I need to finish my degree (ArcGIS Pro and others).  So I decided to reuse some of the components in my current rig in order to maximize the dollars spent on the fun stuff.  Which means I plan on reusing my existing 800D chassis, the EK 360 rad and D5 pump/reservoir setup, and my AX1200i PSU, all of which have performed absolutely flawlessly over the last decade and only now is my case showing its age a bit.  My current monitor is a 24"" 144hz 1080p which I would love to replace with a widescreen 1440 or perhaps 4k in the future.





Here is what I have put together so far:

CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3950X 3.5 GHz 16-Core Processor  ($719.99 @ Amazon)

Motherboard: Asus ROG Crosshair VIII Hero (WI-FI) ATX AM4 Motherboard  ($379.99 @ Newegg)

Total: $2077.95

Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts when available

In the past when I've built new rigs I've gone all out so it's been a challenge not choosing every top of the line part out there and sticking to a budget.  I'm a little brand loyal but when their components have lasted 10+ years it's hard to argue against.



You probably noticed I don't have any type of cooler in there.  That's where the EK-Quantum Momentum ROG Crosshair VIII Hero D-RGB comes in along with an additional EK 120mm radiator to the cooling loop.  So factor in about $250-300 for those items along with the required fittings, tubing etc. I go back and forth a lot on 3950x vs 3900x as well as spending the extra $$$ and getting a 2080 super instead of the 2070.  Also, I considered going with CL 14 memory but its double the cost of the ones I have on the list, from what I understand Zen 2 likes ram speed and CL isn't as important/worth the extra cost? (I could be wrong)



My biggest concern is the fact that Zen 3 is coming towards the end of 2020 in addition to Big Navi.  Waiting feels like the best choice in the long term since I've already gone 10 years so whats another 6-7 months?



But the age of my current rig has REALLY started to show and it's hard not to pull the trigger on something right now (especially since Asus X570 finally restocked today on newegg) and since I will be finding myself spending almost all of my time at home for potentially the rest of 2020, I'd like to maximize my enjoyment while I'm here.



I'm also not planning to upgrade the new rig since my other hobby (offroading/overlanding) usually takes up most of my time and money and I'll soon have kids and a mortgage to worry about along with the cost of living in California.  For now I just want something that can play the latest games and perhaps a few titles of the future and be my ArcGIS/productivity workstation.  Ideally I'd like the rig to hopefully last 5+ years knowing that over time I will have to lower settings on games to keep acceptable FPS.



Would you wait for the next hardware release? Do you think reusing parts of my now 10 year old rig isn't a good idea?  What other parts would you choose? Should I watercool the GPU as well?  Are you tired of getting asked the same upgrade questions 1892372 different ways?



Thanks in advance!

			The strangest thing happened this morning when I got home from work. ( I works nights)  I fired up prime95 over a plate of waffles and this time when the Tdie temps got to 67.75, it started to throttle. During the 40 minute stress test, when the temps dropped, the clock speed went back up. The clock speeds fluctuated between 3.2 and 3.7 ghz but the temp never got above 67.75. I have no idea why it would not do that yesterday.  It seems now its doing what its supposed to do.

I'm not that worried any more, but I still would like to know what is different now and why it wouldn't do this  yesterday.

The Unify is fine, the early owners of other low $ MSI boards weren't so happy.



I'm kinda seeing the x570 Tomahawk as the board that would have raked in the $200 general use segment for them if it was 1 of their launch boards.



I have a b450 tomahawk here I've got for an older kid 1st gaming PC build.  You can see the quality, but also looking at the spec sheets of this board vs the Max version there's that iterative MSI release ladder clearly visible.

IANAG (Geologist) but after a quick search on ArcGIS Pro's accelleration capabilities it seems like it's restricted to Nvidia cards only and no OpenCL support (it's so great when companies give open standards the finger - I'm looking at you too, Matlab! /s)

https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/gpu-processing-with-spatial-analyst.htm

and it can use at a maximum 32 threads per CPU

https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/geostatistical-analyst/parallel-processing-with-multiple-cpus.htm



However, because you say that it's for your studies, I'm assuming that you're not throwing 150+TB of information through it? If you want to speed up this program specifically, you might want to evaluate the potential return on investment for your future for grabbing a 16- or 32-core CPU (dunno if hyperthreading will be a help or a hinderance) or an Nvidia GPU vs AMD GPU. I think the X5670 should serve you well for your studies at the very least. What are you currently studying, masters?



Also, consider 64GB of RAM if you're going to be doing more than gaming. I doubled my RAM to 32GB a year or so ago thinking that it's complete overkill and that I'm wasting my money. Nope! It's turned out SUPER useful.  If you REALLY want it to carry you 10+ years, be sure to leave some open RAM slots so that upgrading to 128GB will be cheaper down the line. This bit me with my E6750's mobo with only two DIMM slots. My current i7-6700 mobo has 4x RAM slots, I have 2x 16GB modules for this exact reason.



I suppose you already know this, but try and get a really good top GPU card if you want it to last 10+years.



Lastly, are you SURE that your PSU is good? You really don't want your PSU popping your shiny new bags of awesome. Even if you take a 3950X at 250W peak (it's really max 150W) plus, say, a rather exaggerated 500W peak for your next-gen GFX card (a factory OC'd 2080 Ti draws around 335W max,) a good Platinum 750W PSU costs about USD150.

Edit:

Does ArcGIS Pro support AVX512 (currently Intel only) accelleration and does it perform significantly better with AVX512 as opposed to AVX2? If so and if it is important enough to you, navigating the mess that is AVX512 support might warrant consideration."

			So, and let me know if i'm reading ANY of this correctly.



As a preface: My ambient temperature right now sucks. It's summer, it's hot, my office doesn't have AC. My ambient temp is probably at least 30'c.



So, I reinstalled my massive cooler, I adjusted it, made sure that it was making contact, did a few tweaks to try and force contact. I took the cpu out and made sure the damn things actually connected, i've done everything aside from straight up lapping it.



I'm still getting around 50c idle.  Now, from the research i've been doing.  My ""idle"" isn't truly idle.  I have constant monitoring services open.  I have afterburner for my GPU, and I use rainmeter for monitoring things like temperatures, individual core usage, fan speeds, and most importantly, I have a monitoring service for my 9 hard drives.



Temps went down after i adjusted how the heatsink was installed, load temps went down MASSIVELY.  (I'm talking 95c throttling is now about 80'c during a prime-95 stress test.  Still way too high but... better, shows my heatsink is actually working.)



I booted up HWinfo64 to check my clocks and saw that new Power Reporting Deviation metric that's been making all the rounds lately.  I've read a few articles on it and, well.  Things are bad  I'm seeing that 95% to is considered good.



Mines reporting around 60%. Which means in theory that my cpu is constantly pulling around 2V and my idle is at 1.5v and no wonder i'm getting boosts to 4.6ghz constantly and everything is running so hot.



So I said fuck it. I went to my UEFI, turned my SOC down to 1.00, turned my offset voltage to the lowest it could go, -.1 and went to see if it booted.  Most of what i've read said that this is basically a situation that would never boot.  Mine did.



It booted fine, it stress tested fine, hell, my cinebench numbers are practically identical.  This makes me think that that Power Reporting Deviation is actually true.  I've been juicing my CPU a full near 50% higher volts than required.

I've only had it running this way for a few hours now but I don't see any reason that I need to change it unless it becomes unstable.



So, i'm assuming this is likely a motherboard issue? This won't be fixed from a BIOS update because I'm frankly amazed this low tier, launch, discontinued, x370 board got as many bios updates as it has.



So, with some more messing around and doings things manually -



I turned on voltage at a constant 1.1  and boost clock to 3.8, my idle went down to 42c, my load temp was about 65c.  I'm gonna mess around with this some more, but is there a way to set a max boost clock that doesn't become a constant all core clock?  Or is that something that I'd need to use Ryzen Master to tweak?
		
		Click to expand...
	
I suggest you not randomly adjust things w/o fully understanding the apparatus underneath. Take the power deviation, if you got 95% that means your board is not lying to your cpu. And that deviation number is only valid during an allcore situation with all cores loaded like running a Cinebench multi run.



I again warn that it's dangerous to make guesses about the voltage. If you got 60%, that means you or your board is reporting less power draw than what the cpu thinks it should have. Your cpu is not using 2V, thinking like that is way off the mark my man. Again, with you using negative voltage settings YOU are limiting the power consumption to the cpu. Anyone can test this easily by comparing their power deviation at stock vs a negative offset. The negative offset will produce numbers well below 95%."

With some of these companies the care package makes sense because then you don't have to worry about getting screwed over after it just is out of warranty.

I don't see any point in an extended warranty from the OEM themselves. Often times if something breaks, they just replace it with the same defective part that lasts nearly the same amount of time and breaks again, just this time out of the extended warranty period and you're SOL. The DV 6000/9000 models were notorious for this, I repaired this one DV9000 for a customer three times because HP kept sending replacement boards with the exact same defect.



Extended warranties used to be about ""what ifs"", but now they're about letting the manufacturer build products ever cheaper and ever more disposable."

			Well I am concerned with VR titles which are 4K+ by default. I am trying to figure out how much the CPU is the bottleneck @ 4K and not to just pour all my $ into GPU.

"" In one of the few games I do care about FPS, I can finally go over 110FPS in Doom Eternal is now around 150fps. at 1440p. HUGE increase there. ""

Yes a big increase. But 110 fps isn't limiting at all, or is it? and it is @ a meager 1440p. I thought you gamed at 4K?

VR, especially dx11 titles, can hit cpu limits due to draw call limits.  Since it has 2 views to draw, high geometry complexity can hit the cpu extremely hard, especially if single pass stereo (nvidia) or liquidvr (amd) aren't used.  It's very game dependent, but there are a couple of popular simulators that have that issue and really need high single core speed.  Two I know of are x-plane and iracing.  Going from zen 1 to zen 2 can be worth 20-25% in those as fill rate is not the limiting factor.  Iracing does support single pass stereo but it's still cpu limited on anything over a gtx1070.



I'd suggest finding the forum of the games you care about as there are usually extensive discussions about vr performance there and what hardware and settings result in the best performance."

So the 3300x will get the 4+0 ccx config that budget gamers were hoping for while the 3100 gets the 2+2 ccx that will have much a higher latency. 



This is why early leeks show the 3300x matching a stock 7700k at stock speeds and beating it in MT when overclocked as AMD SMT seems to be more effective.

			Are you guys sure GPU encoding still sucks? I find that as long as I keep the bitrate close to the original file that it looks nearly identical? It's when I use a pre-configured profile is when the video quality degrades. Youtube degrades video quality more than anything and Facebook drops 4k down to 720p! But my local rendered files look pretty much as good as the originals using GPU encoding and sticking to a similar bitrate. Maybe that was a problem on older GPUs and software? Anyway, real time smooth high quality 4k/x265 previews on a high quality video editor under $100 (I pay around $50 to upgrade from one version to the next) without having to make proxies is a game changer for me!

			I find these numbers always weird because in the end what do you do with your computer? We saw the 29% number when dealing with financial programs.



How many times have we seen something approach 10% gains over last generation at same frequency  (not the compiler optimized crap you see all the time). That makes me wonder if that 7nm process is that great to carry such a large amount of the improvements even if they say it is working up to 4.5ghz?



With DDR5 (supposedly much faster) being introduced next year (if i'm not mistaken) the x570 even with all the PCI E lanes seems a bit to much.

In the past you seen 32nm to 28 to 22 to 18 to 14+++++++++++++++++++++ to 12 and now to 7nm. The biggest shrink possibly ever in modern computing may very well be 12/14 to 7nm. That's a 50% reduction in process size in one iteration from the last.



Is there not be any expected benefit to dropping the node size literally in half?"

I wonder if they will have or offer a trade up program (lol pipe dream I know) for current Threadripper owners for the next gen. Its kind of a stab to the face in a way that we spent $1000 on our 2950x's that in just a year or less they come out with a desktop part that is going to have 16 faster cores @ 7nm.



I guess that is the risk you have with technology.



I might ditch threadripper if the new Zen 2 is significantly faster in multithread workloads even at dual channel memory.

I used to just put a blob in the center and let it spread out automatically when I put the heatsink or waterblock on, but that usually either resulted in paste never making it to the corners of the heat-spreader, or excess paste squished off the side of the heat-spreader in a messy manner, depending on how much paste I used. 



Prime95 Small FFT with AVX enabled is pretty much going to be a worst case scenario in terms of heat, and not representative of real-world usage.  What temperatures do you get during a run of something like Cinebench R20?



Using my Cooler Master ML360R 360mm AIO with 6 high static-pressure high-CFM fans in push-pull, an aggressive fan curve, and ambient temperatures in the low 70's (Fahrenheit) results in temps of about 76C during Prime95 Small FFT with AVX.  But I also have my radiator on an intake, so it's always being fed fresh cool air, and I don't have my GPU contributing heat to the liquid either.

I'll have to double check but I think i get 4.725 on like 4 cores across my 3950x.  However, that's not sustained and it depends on a lot of things other than cooling (like some stupid programs forcing highest p-state regardless of load, forcing all cores to max boost).  In those cases, under low load (Ie only a couple of cores actually loaded but all set to max boost) I'm seeing ~4.4-4.5 stock across all cores (no PBO).  If the cores are actually loaded it varies between 4.0 and 4.25 depending on the program.  I do have an AIO, but nothing particularly high end or fancy, it just fit my case better than any decent air cooler.

Vendors are also better at bios updates, boards are built better and last longer, etc.  I've been bitten by WAY too many cheap boards over the years; I keep systems till they die 90% of the time - they just move on from being a primary to my wife, on to a server, NAS, etc.  Last time I went budget on a board was one of the ones that hit the list here as ""worst motherboards of all time"", and my fancy X370 board has only a really shitty cheap BIOS update for Zen2 because MSI doesn't care when you bought a $150-200 board.  



Vice versa, every time I've bought a high end board, it's lasted at least 10 years and done everything I could have ever asked of it, even if some of the stuff wasn't used for the second half of its life.  My Core2 system just finally gave up the ghost about a year ago.  Was doing duty as a small NAS in the end.  



That's one place (the other is the AIB GPU I buy) I'm very particular.  I just want shit to ~work~, and high end boards tend to just ~work~."

			Hello guys,



for some of you this might be a stupid question but I am just gonna try it. I am in situation, where I would like to buy new rig for 1440p, 144hz gaming. I realise it's pointless buying 2000 series nvida gpus, when new one's are just around the corner. The problem is my friend wants to buy my old rig (without GPU) now, so I want to buy everything except GPU now. My question is, what cpu is suitable for new gpus. I know there are not a lot of specifications of new gpus, but for example, do you think I am save with AMD Ryzen 5 3600 ? Or that one is too low for that. I hope the question is understandable.



Thank you for your responses.

It is a stupid question but, so what.  Get the best processor available that you can afford along with the best B550 board you can afford and you will be fine. Personally, I would get a 3950X with a Asrock Taichi B550 or Gigabyte Aorus B550 and love it. However, it is not needed for a great gaming experience but then again, I would love me a TR40 board and 3960X."

3900 - $33 per core

3950x - $41/core, add one VM or so.

3960x - $59/core, but you're going all the way to 24 cores which would (in my mind at least) double the number of running VMs, vs one more.  Or transcode and game at the same time, etc.  In my mind, of course.   Not sure if that's sane, this is a new market for me, and I'm trying to think it through.



Motherboards are about the same cost right now; since I won't do anything but a higher-end x570 board.  Crosshair VIII Formula or Meg Ace both end at around $600 right now, the MSI creator is $700.  RAM is the same, cooler is the same, case is the same...  only difference is the CPU.

			So does AMD. AMD has charged more than Intel at times when it could get away with it. AMD's current top end HEDT CPU is $4,000. Intel's only at a quarter of that. When the Core i9 10980XE paper launched, AMD's top end (at that time) 3970X was $2,000. It's entry into the HEDT space was already $400 more than the 10980XE. On the mainstream segment side, AMD's top offering is more than $200 more expensive than anything Intel has. Now, on the AMD side you get more performance than Intel offers in everything but gaming above and below the 10980XE. Even where Intel is competitive, it's often still more expensive. For example, the Ryzen 5 3400G is less expensive than the Core i5 9400K. The 9400K is a good deal better, APU vs. iGPU not withstanding, but you do pay more for it.

you are using a 3950X and i assume you  use this for more than playing games. 3990X is aimed at a specific segment because Intel can not compete. At the high end they are charging alot. I am not a Intel hater by any means. For one thing i can not afford these outrageous prices from either camp. I just want all round good performance. Have a 3600X for gaming and looking to replace it with a 3700X,becuase i want to do some rendering ect. not put my self into poverty."

			I got my Ryzen 1700 and Asrock X370 Gaming K4 Fatal1ty at Ryzen launch.  It was literally the only motherboard I could find in stock at the time I bought it, and it's been holding up decently well.  RAM speed has been an issue.  Constantly.  I've never been able to run RAM over 3000 and be stable.



I've had the upgrade itch lately, mostly because there are a lot of games that I can't play at high refresh rates (such as Doom Eternal) or i'm straight up CPU throttled (Planet Coaster, Planet Zoo, etc.)



I did my research and the Gaming K4 X370 is 8+4 phase VRM. It does have a beta bios that has support for 3900X and 3950X. My power supply should be able to handle it, and I can get the cooling required - but what are the chances that this is somehow gonna go sideways? I'm not really interested in overclocking once I get the 3900X in there, I've been running my 1700 at 3.9ghz for 3 years now and I'm sure that the 3900X is gonna be a noticeable increase even at stock.



Am I worrying too damn much?



I'm not looking to upgrade my motherboard at this time, i'm literally just wanting to get the best processor I can into this system right now.  I'll likely get an X570 or B550 motherboard to get a Ryzen 4000 series CPU in the future, however I want this system to be the best it can be before I give it to my SO.



Also, on the BIOS page it warns to not update the BIOS unless you're gonna upgrade your CPU. I'm still using P 5.1 because of those warnings, but I'd assume that I just slowly upgrade each bios until I hit 5.8 BEFORE I attempt to install the 3900X (3950X) when I get one?

https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/Fatal1ty X370 Gaming K4/index.asp#BIOS
		
		Click to expand...
	
it's not an 8+4, it's actually a 4+2 configuration with 3 dual drivers and 2 H/L mosfets per driver channel(signal -> driver -> into 2x2 highside/2x2 lowside mosfets). the biggest complaint most people have the board is VRM temps so i wouldn't trust it with a 3950x even stock.. maybe a stock 3900x if you're able to lower stock voltage without loosing any boost performance and have good case airflow over the VRM heatsinks. otherwise i'd say that sub 200 dollar board had a good life and might be time to move up to a higher quality board if you're going to drop 400+ dollars on a cpu. another option since your eventual plan is to move that board on to some one else, i'd actually look at the 3700x. the board should be able to handle that processor just fine and you'll be very close to the same performance in most games to the 3900x.



as far as bios updates go, follow the notes in P5.4 before updating since you're already on P5.1.. 3950 needs P5.5 to run, all the others will work with P5.4 then you can update to P5.8 after the new chips installed.

			This is true, but it also means a lot of people are hesitant to purchase right now.  There are no options.  People waiting is no good for business either.  I get it, the x570 is their own design they make money from, b550 is made by 3rd party.  They wanted to be the only one in the market to make some $.  Still leaves a bad taste as most figured (and AMD did nothing to tamp out rumors) since the b550 was so late to the party they might as well pick up a b450 or x470.  That all said, it's mildly annoying but doesn't bother me enough to really care, which is probably what they are backing on.



Edit:. Just for example, I was hoping to update my b450 with a new CPU, buy a new MB and drop my old chip into a server to replace my old one, and get my son one of the 3300x's.  I was ready to start buying things up then realized it's a no go.  So now I'll sit in limbo for months instead of buying 2 new CPUs and new MB's...

			Yeah, if you’re running all threads full out all the time and are overclocked without speedshift and adaptive voltage. But, you typically are not.



As mentioned many times my 9900k uses 50w peak while playing games, at 5ghz all cores, with cache at 4.7. Temps are barely above 50C and fans are barely ticking over.



Unless I got super lucky and won the silicon lottery (unlikely), you must be doing something wrong to always hit high temps.
		
		Click to expand...
	
What AVX are you running? 5 Ghz all core means nothing if AVX is offset. Also what voltage? You'd be the first guy I ever heard say the 9900K@5 ghz uses little peak power and doesn't get overly hot. In fact here's what Tom's had to say: https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i9-9900k-9th-gen-cpu,5847-11.html








	
	
		
		
			But power becomes more of an issue in some productivity applications because a constant load on all cores at high clock rates is almost too much. And to be clear, the Core i9-9900K gets super hot faced with Prime95 and AVX instructions (205W stock, 250W overclocked), exceeding the specified TDP.



We measured 137W (232W) during the Cinebench test, and we topped 145W (241W overclocked) under the larger Blender workload.
		
		Click to expand...
	
And before you say ""oh that's with constant workload and AVX"" well guess what? Most new games utilize AVX and even Apex Legends now pushes the CPU hard with AVX on. I find it very deceptive when people sometimes try to claim, ""oh my 9900k@5/5.1 ghz runs so nice and cool"" when they're running non-AVX games and/or benchmarks and then also fail to disclose they have AVX offsets w/their so-called golden silicon chips.

			Sir I want to follow along, but are you saying that Ryzen is perfect out of the box and it is just monitoring software giving bad temp readings? It has been proven that motherboard manufacturers are juicing the voltages, or at least the readings reported to the chip. I understand that Ryzen shows high voltage at idle then decreases under load. I am not panicking over that. So I need to follow that last link first? Edit: looks like you deleted that part. This is confusing, that reddit post says stock voltage is unsafe. This is what I am talking about. I am not trying to be combative, but you claim that only one monitoring service is right, then to tweak memory then a reddit post that says I need to lower voltage. I really do appreciate the responses, I am sorry if I am not getting some obvious thing.
		
		Click to expand...
	
I hadn't read this edited post so here goes. I didn't delete anything from my main points.



First the reddit post is NOT talking about stock voltages. It is dealing with manual voltages, what is safe, and how to figure your chip's safe voltage.



I'm not making any claims that were NOT already put forward by AMD themselves, and you WILL see that when you research even a lil bit. What I was showing you is how to use hwinfo to not only avoid the observer effect, but to harness it's awesome feature set. There's a handful of other seriously unbeaten reasons to use afterburner/rtss/hwinfo too. The way it integrates with afterburner and riva statistics is insanely powerful. There are a few tricks to using afterburner that many ppl still do not know now. Like for ex. afterburner is the easiest and quickest way to check on hardware acceleration on the desktop. A lot of the weird shit that happens on windows desktop is because of apps calling for hardware acceleration, add to that the fact that all this is done w/o informing the user. Thankfully the easiest way of listing apps calling for hw accel is afterburner, and the easiest way of controlling whether an app gets hw accel or not is with rtss.



For ex.








	
	
		
		
			Apparently, most modern CPU monitoring utilities cause what is known as ""the observer effect:"" the process of measuring the processor's load itself causes load on the processor.



""We have determined that many popular monitoring tools are quite aggressive in how they monitor the behavior of a core. Some of them wake every core in the system for 20 ms, and do this as often as every 200 ms. From the perspective of the processor firmware, this is interpreted as a workload that's asking for sustained performance from the core(s). The firmware is designed to respond to such a pattern by boosting: higher clocks, higher voltages,"" stated Robert Hallock, AMD's head of technical marketing for processors. ""So, if you're sitting there staring at your monitoring tool, the tool is constantly instructing all the cores to wake up and boost. This will keep the clock-speeds high, and the corresponding voltages will be elevated to support that boost. This is a classic case of observer effect: you're expecting the tool to give valid data, but it's actually producing invalid data by virtue of how it's measuring,"" he added.

			My results with Crucial Ballistix LT (Micron e-die) 2x8GB kit with XMP 3200 16-18-18.   Motherboard is MSI x570 Gaming Plus.  CPU is 3600X.



1T max was 3600 14-19-16-36 @1.41v (I added 0.01v for 24/7 after validating 1.41v overnight.)

2T 3800 15-20-17-38 @ 1.40v (I added 0.01v for 24/7 after validating 1.40v overnight.)

Here are the screenshots with Ryzen Master showing all timings / subtimings & AIDA 64 Read / Copy / Latency.  These have also been validated HCI memtest overnight ~1000% each thread for both:

3600 - 


	
 and 3800 - 


	


Ran Shadow of the Tomb Raider as a benchmark, since this was in a system with a crappy video card during performance optimization I do for my new CPUs before putting them into my main system, and I will never be able to get a CPU bottleneck.  SoTR benchmark reports a supposed ""If there was a CPU bottleneck it would be at"" FPS.  While this may or may not be valid, the trend should be valid enough to prove the point of how memory will affect a CPU limited scenario.



I ran 1080P most settings maxed (no HBAO or Motion Blur) in the following speed / timings:

3200 XMP / XMP @ 1900 Infinity Fabric / 3600 14-19-16 / 3800 15-20-17 / 3600 - subtimings tuned / 3800 - subtimings tuned

AVG FPS (multiple runs, averaged, rounded to nearest 0.5FPS):

125.0 / 125.5 / 132.5 / 133.5 / 139.5 / 141.0

5% low FPS:

95.5 / 95.0 / 99.5 / 100.5 / 106.0 / 107.0



During this I had the CPU locked at 4.0 GHz to minimize run to run variation.  When CPU was left stock and allowed to boost, results were all over the place.  When kept at 4.0GHz, the performance was VERY steady, with sigma ~1 FPS for AVG and under 1 FPS for 5% lows.  As an example, for the 16 runs that I did for 3600 & 3800 w/ subtimings tuned (8 each) only 3 runs for 5% lows were not a 106 or 107 (2 105s on 3600 and one 108 on 3800).  Even though there's only 1 FPS difference between the 3800 and 3600 tuned subs 5% lows, the variation was low enough that I am confident that the difference is statistically significant.



Overall it demonstrates just how much improvement can be had from subtimings.  Sure speed and latency are important, but 3200 16-18-18 --> 3600 14-19-16 offered slightly less improvement than just tightening subtimings at 3600 or 3800. I'm sure 3800 would offer even more improvement if I didn't have to drop to 2T command rate, but that's what it took.  1T wasn't stable even at 3666 20-22-22.



Overall, I'm pretty happy with this from a kit of memory that was 16GB for $80 including tax and shipping.  Sure b-die would do better, but it's way more pricey.  Considering I don't often game in CPU limited scenarios anyway, expensive memory doesn't make sense.  This kit was great with a midrange price, but able to overclock to decidedly higher than midrange performance.

Nice results, especially form an $80 kit.  I wish I had known Asus was going to break radio silence and post a new BIOS release on the 31st like they did.  I would have waited to order my 32GB B die kit (but it was a good deal at $190 vs $130 for every 16GB b die kit!) In order to give my Micron E Die kit (same as yours but again was a 32GB DR 3200c16 kit) a fair shot at getting stable.

Max temp I can get with small FTT in Prime95 is 72c CPU and 73c VRM.  (Both of which are higher than I've ever seen it in a non simulated scenario.)   I'm partially writing this down for my own sake.

			Is there a way to test what the actual voltage is that your RAM is getting?  Or does the setting in the motherboard determine the sensor reading? I have my RAM set to 1.35 in the BIOS but according to HWinfo64 it's reading 1.36v  So I'm guessing the latter is more accurate?

The sensing capability comes from the voltage controller. However, some motherboards do have voltage check points for you to read this information directly. Typically, this is only available on more expensive models. And setting to 1.35v does not preclude a slightly higher reading either. Your voltages are fine so long as they are within roughly 10% +/- of the setting."

			So does AMD. AMD has charged more than Intel at times when it could get away with it. AMD's current top end HEDT CPU is $4,000. Intel's only at a quarter of that. When the Core i9 10980XE paper launched, AMD's top end (at that time) 3970X was $2,000. It's entry into the HEDT space was already $400 more than the 10980XE. On the mainstream segment side, AMD's top offering is more than $200 more expensive than anything Intel has. Now, on the AMD side you get more performance than Intel offers in everything but gaming above and below the 10980XE. Even where Intel is competitive, it's often still more expensive. For example, the Ryzen 5 3400G is less expensive than the Core i5 9400K. The 9400K is a good deal better, APU vs. iGPU not withstanding, but you do pay more for it.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Why are you comparing the price of a 32 core 64 thread CPU to the price of an 18 core 36 thread CPU?  Of course the 32/64 CPU is going to 'cost' more.  



As for why I chose AMD.  It was all about what I could get for the money I wanted to spend at the time.  Then it progressed into me spending even more money since I then upgrade AMD CPU's around 6 months after I first built the rig.  Went from a 2600 to a 3900x.  Then I wanted a better MB so I upgraded that.  Did I need to, no, but I wanted to.  When the 4000 series comes out I  will most likely upgrade the chip again, not the MB because I am happy with that.  But in this case at least I can just buy a new CPU and use everything else I already have, unlike Intel where I would need a new board as well.  Which would lead to me probably buying other crap because, why not I already have to remove everything and install it again."

I understand, but also keep in mind that you are the one who specifically mentioned 144Hz and said nothing else about it.

			I swear ian missed the forest from the trees. This is a serious issue in the context that if you didn't know about it and think your cpu is doing what it's supposed to be doing. And then you go to overclock like the majority of users who don't read or research anbd they end up jacking PBO up or running random manual voltages. That's a recipe for issues. And Ian's also wrong about degradation as it can happen at mild voltages under typical cooling. Stilt's shown this and he's been hunting for that missing power envelope for a year now.



Threads like this lead ppl down a bad ending and it only gets worse if the board at the outset is lying to the cpu.

I disagree.  If you're setting a voltage manually, then you are overriding the PBO, etc.  You might actually be running less voltage if you set something in bios vs. allowing PBO to do its thing.



I don't think it's something to be worried about.  At least not in the average lifespan of the CPUs.  I haven't seen anyone complaining about degradation with 1st gen Ryzens and they've been out for 4 years now.  So it lasts 8 years instead of 15.  It's outside the normal lifespan of the CPU anyway."

This is true, but it also means a lot of people are hesitant to purchase right now.  There are no options.  People waiting is no good for business either.  I get it, the x570 is their own design they make money from, b550 is made by 3rd party.  They wanted to be the only one in the market to make some $.  Still leaves a bad taste as most figured (and AMD did nothing to tamp out rumors) since the b550 was so late to the party they might as well pick up a b450 or x470.  That all said, it's mildly annoying but doesn't bother me enough to really care, which is probably what they are backing on.



Edit:. Just for example, I was hoping to update my b450 with a new CPU, buy a new MB and drop my old chip into a server to replace my old one, and get my son one of the 3300x's.  I was ready to start buying things up then realized it's a no go.  So now I'll sit in limbo for months instead of buying 2 new CPUs and new MB's..."

Let's assume you've spent the coin on an edge case monitor like 1440p 240hz, or 4k 144hz.  Very quickly you'll find there will be a multi gen ramp up of gpu and cpu to feed that monitor.



I like restraining my builds to the here and now.

I've burned enough $ on builds centered around a monitor that's 3 years away from flat frametime and no tune gaming.



Recording and streaming as an exercise taught me that resolution and framerate tuning is no diff than when I used to bracket race cars. 



You cannot just throw parts at your pile of junk constantly over time without focus on tuning to output.



Everyone wants to do 200mph on salt flats, but the commitment to build usually isn't there.

			So does AMD. AMD has charged more than Intel at times when it could get away with it. AMD's current top end HEDT CPU is $4,000. Intel's only at a quarter of that. When the Core i9 10980XE paper launched, AMD's top end (at that time) 3970X was $2,000. It's entry into the HEDT space was already $400 more than the 10980XE. On the mainstream segment side, AMD's top offering is more than $200 more expensive than anything Intel has. Now, on the AMD side you get more performance than Intel offers in everything but gaming above and below the 10980XE. Even where Intel is competitive, it's often still more expensive. For example, the Ryzen 5 3400G is less expensive than the Core i5 9400K. The 9400K is a good deal better, APU vs. iGPU not withstanding, but you do pay more for it.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Yes, if AMD was pricing the stuff like Intel would, the 3990WX would be $8000 and the 2990WX would be $4000. Heck, the 3950X would be $2000 so, AMD pricing is where it actually should be, in comparison to what Intel charges."

Has enough cores for most games and decent boost clocks on zen 2.  Most benches I've found have the 3300x out in front of the 7700k in most things, which is pretty impressive for a $120 chip.  So my choices for his platform are find a used 7700k for $200+... Or buy the 3300x for $120 + $80 MB... For $200 brand new and have more performance.  If i were to go Intel, what can you get for that price that can keep up with/outpace a 7700k?

Motherboard is MSI x570 Gaming Plus.  CPU is 3600X.



1T max was 3600 14-19-16-36 @1.41v (I added 0.01v for 24/7 after validating 1.41v overnight.)

2T 3800 15-20-17-38 @ 1.40v (I added 0.01v for 24/7 after validating 1.40v overnight.)

Here are the screenshots with Ryzen Master showing all timings / subtimings & AIDA 64 Read / Copy / Latency.  These have also been validated HCI memtest overnight ~1000% each thread for both:

3600 - 


	
 and 3800 - 


	


Ran Shadow of the Tomb Raider as a benchmark, since this was in a system with a crappy video card during performance optimization I do for my new CPUs before putting them into my main system, and I will never be able to get a CPU bottleneck.  SoTR benchmark reports a supposed ""If there was a CPU bottleneck it would be at"" FPS.  While this may or may not be valid, the trend should be valid enough to prove the point of how memory will affect a CPU limited scenario.



I ran 1080P most settings maxed (no HBAO or Motion Blur) in the following speed / timings:

3200 XMP / XMP @ 1900 Infinity Fabric / 3600 14-19-16 / 3800 15-20-17 / 3600 - subtimings tuned / 3800 - subtimings tuned

AVG FPS (multiple runs, averaged, rounded to nearest 0.5FPS):

125.0 / 125.5 / 132.5 / 133.5 / 139.5 / 141.0

5% low FPS:

95.5 / 95.0 / 99.5 / 100.5 / 106.0 / 107.0



During this I had the CPU locked at 4.0 GHz to minimize run to run variation.  When CPU was left stock and allowed to boost, results were all over the place.  When kept at 4.0GHz, the performance was VERY steady, with sigma ~1 FPS for AVG and under 1 FPS for 5% lows.  As an example, for the 16 runs that I did for 3600 & 3800 w/ subtimings tuned (8 each) only 3 runs for 5% lows were not a 106 or 107 (2 105s on 3600 and one 108 on 3800).  Even though there's only 1 FPS difference between the 3800 and 3600 tuned subs 5% lows, the variation was low enough that I am confident that the difference is statistically significant.



Overall it demonstrates just how much improvement can be had from subtimings.  Sure speed and latency are important, but 3200 16-18-18 --> 3600 14-19-16 offered slightly less improvement than just tightening subtimings at 3600 or 3800. I'm sure 3800 would offer even more improvement if I didn't have to drop to 2T command rate, but that's what it took.  1T wasn't stable even at 3666 20-22-22.



Overall, I'm pretty happy with this from a kit of memory that was 16GB for $80 including tax and shipping.  Sure b-die would do better, but it's way more pricey.  Considering I don't often game in CPU limited scenarios anyway, expensive memory doesn't make sense.  This kit was great with a midrange price, but able to overclock to decidedly higher than midrange performance.

These paper launches from AMD are driving me nuts.  And it's even more frustrating that these CPUs are available in Europe and Canada.  AMD is US-based, and we invented the Internet.... So I don't get why they would not launch here first. It's not like Canada is closer to Taiwan where TSMC is.

On my system with my current settings, where I run with a -0,1V offset to the core voltage, HWiNFO64 reports a Power Report Deviation (PRD) of about 75%. Which seems rather bad (lower percentage is supposed to mean the CPU is using more power than its specified to do).



Going into the BIOS and setting core voltage to auto, makes PRD report about a 95% deviation which should be a better result. Though in this state the CPU is clearly using a lot more power and running hotter.



Both of these was running CB R20.



So if you are playing around with core voltage offsets, the numbers don't seem to add up?

			Well, I downloaded the beta and I'm reporting 115% power deviation on my Asus board and 3600x (RandomX mining), so evidently, my understanding is that I'm actually over-reporting and I'm actually drawing less power?



I did a more standard ""stress"" test with AVX2 and it showed 103%.



So my understanding of this number based on the Tech Jesus video and looking back in the actual thread over at the HWInfo forums is that the reported power draw is 103% of the actual power draw meaning that I'm actually drawing some 3% less than reported (which is a confusing way to phrase what they are after).  When they showed an early ASRock bios (in the Tech Jesus video) and the number was somewhere in the 80% range, it's saying that the reported power draw was only 80% of the actual power draw meaning that it's drawing some 25% more than it should.

103% just means the bios is reporting a slightly higher voltage than the cpu VID voltage which means you're potentially losing some boost performance since the cpu thinks it's using more power than it really is but doubt it makes a real world difference."

			I got my Ryzen 1700 and Asrock X370 Gaming K4 Fatal1ty at Ryzen launch.  It was literally the only motherboard I could find in stock at the time I bought it, and it's been holding up decently well.  RAM speed has been an issue.  Constantly.  I've never been able to run RAM over 3000 and be stable.



I've had the upgrade itch lately, mostly because there are a lot of games that I can't play at high refresh rates (such as Doom Eternal) or i'm straight up CPU throttled (Planet Coaster, Planet Zoo, etc.)



I did my research and the Gaming K4 X370 is 8+4 phase VRM. It does have a beta bios that has support for 3900X and 3950X. My power supply should be able to handle it, and I can get the cooling required - but what are the chances that this is somehow gonna go sideways? I'm not really interested in overclocking once I get the 3900X in there, I've been running my 1700 at 3.9ghz for 3 years now and I'm sure that the 3900X is gonna be a noticeable increase even at stock.



Am I worrying too damn much?



I'm not looking to upgrade my motherboard at this time, i'm literally just wanting to get the best processor I can into this system right now.  I'll likely get an X570 or B550 motherboard to get a Ryzen 4000 series CPU in the future, however I want this system to be the best it can be before I give it to my SO.



Also, on the BIOS page it warns to not update the BIOS unless you're gonna upgrade your CPU. I'm still using P 5.1 because of those warnings, but I'd assume that I just slowly upgrade each bios until I hit 5.8 BEFORE I attempt to install the 3900X (3950X) when I get one?

			My 6700k only does 4.4Ghz so that's my base on what I'm looking to improve from (I feel like I've been using this CPU forever, definitely my longest lasting CPU)

I game mainly at 1440p and like to crank on the eye candy as high as possible on a 144Hz G-Sync monitor but sometimes play on my 4K HDR 60Hz TV using a ROG RTX 2080Ti - I will never play or worry about 1080p again so if the only difference would be at 1080p with graphics turned down I'll definitely skip upgrading



I'm considering AMD because the Intel K series is sold out everywhere I shop.



I also do 4k video editing on Movie Studio Platinum (Thinking about upgrading to Vegas Pro) - But gaming is 1rst priority and what's more important to see a boost in - the rest would be icing on the cake



Motherboard I'm looking at is the ASUS X570 TUF Gaming Plus (WI-FI) AMD AM4 ATX Motherboard - is this a good choice?



I haven't used AMD since the Athlon64 so I really don't know what's more important with ram on these new AMDs - MHz or Latency? Would it be best to get the fastest Mhz ram (like say DDR 4400) and run it at a lower speed (DDR 3600) but at tighter memory timings? Recommend me some ram, preferably something that Microcenter carries in stock so that I could pick it up this weekend.

4k editing... If you are doing cpu rendering then you'll want more cores to throw at it. Gaming at 4k any of the mid upper end cpus will generally speaking be in the same ballpark with some small exceptions like Destiny 2 which loves the 9900/10900 K chips overclocked. That said the Intels are way behind in multi threaded workloads so it comes down to what your true priorities are. Outside of the anamolies like Destiny, is the few percent difference in gaming worth more than multi threaded performance?



That board is decent. And about the vrms, it really doesn't matter a whole lot since these cpus don't draw much wattage anyways. That said I run a Strix-E which is for all intents 98% of a Crosshair for a bit less and obviously it is overkill since the chip doesn't draw more than 140w at max. This whole vrm thing has kind of gotten out of hand. Instead look at the feature set, nvme placement, audio chip, network chip, bios design/layout etc etc. I'm partial to the Asus ROG layout so I generally will lean towards an ROG bios' board.



Now for ram, on AMD side maximum speed is not that important. The sweet spot is 3600mhz (which is easy to attain) with tight timings, most Hynix CJR and B-die will do great. You could even try 3800mhz ram and 1900 fabric which is the max attainable. You could also get faster ram like you wrote and run it slower. That would leave your future options open."

			Yea gaming is the top priority and why I bought a 2080Ti. Video editing I don't really care too much as the latest version of Movie Studio Platinum 17 claims full GPU acceleration and it does seem to run very smooth to the point I don't even have to create smaller cache files of clips anymore and realtime transitions and effects run as smooth as if you where playing back a final fully rendered video so it seems like my video editing workload has been shifted to my mighty 2080Ti so gaming performance is my main concern with the CPU upgrade and anything else would just be considered icing on the cake I guess. I suppose I could wait a bit longer since the system does run pretty good, but I hate the idea that I'm potentially holding back a $1300 graphics card with a old CPU and how much longer until the new Ryzens are released? This fall/winter? I'm pretty sure I've never kept a CPU this long before...the 6700k has been a work horse. It's a shame it only does 4.4GHz and even upping the voltage to 1.45v doesn't make a difference - I must of gotten the worst 6700k on the planet...lol. My last chip a 2500k overclocked right out of the box by 1000Mhz without even touching the voltage. It was the only time in my life that I won the silicon lottery lol.

Thing is the new Ryzen should match or maybe even exceed Intel's latest CPUs in single thread performance while offering more cores and much lower thermals. These intel CPUs are pigs, they run super hot and the IHS is such trash that you can't even dissipate the heat even with a custom WC setup unless you delid it. So that's why I would never consider Intel at this point no matter what as a consumer. I have a 9900k@5 Ghz w/a custom WC setup so that's why I'm telling you from experience. Just hold out a bit longer and go AMD--I plan to get the new Ryzen and toss this Intel trash on eBay ASAP. Already got the mobo + CPU money in hand so just playing the waiting game at this point."

There isn't a definitive guide. But there is an order and process to it. These cpus are very different from previous generations of cpus from AMD and Intel. They react to context changes incredibly fast so if you by default are monitoring the wrong sensors it will ""look"" hotter or worse than it really is. Thus first I'd recommend learning to monitor the cpu the right way. Yea, there's actually a right and wrong way. Read link below for a quick primer on setting up monitoring. Tip, core voltage is SVI2 TFN, cpu temp is cpu die average, clocks are effective clock...



https://hardforum.com/threads/build...2-raid-render-monster.1990145/post-1044457505



Now for your other question getting the best out of the chip. The truth is leaving it stock is best for most users. W/o overclocking the next step is to tweak your memory and max out the infinity fabric clock. We do this by overclocking the memory from say 3600mhz to 3800mhz which is typically the max speed for the fabric, taking it from 1800mhz to 1900mhz. Download dram calculator, use the safe profile for starters and start inputting the timings into your bios. This improves the latency all around and will net a couple % in benchmarks.



https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/ryzen-dram-calculator-by-1usmus.246327/



The next steps are different methods of overclocking, but before that one needs to find the maximum safe voltage. And that begins a whole other ball of wax. The post below is a good cliffnote on voltage and the silicon FITness monitoring. Basically each chip is different so you have to run a specific test to find your own specific chips safe voltage.








	
	
		
		
			So yeah, 1.325V is not safe. The maximum safe voltage for your personal zen 2 cpu is... I have no clue. If you want to be able to find this voltage turn on PBO and max PPT, TDC and EDC and run a worse-case workload as of The Stilts recommendation.



Also do not push past the Fmax on your cpu while at maximum FIT voltage. It can actually make the situation your cpu is in dangerous and add a risk of degradation.
		
		Click to expand...
	
https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ejgc6p/1325v_is_not_safe_for_zen_2/



Once you have your max fit voltage then you can run an allcore overclock or the ratio overclock that manofgod mentioned. Also, keep in mind fmax, that's the frequency you ran the fit test at. The max fit voltage is only good for that fmax, so if you wanna run a higher clock then you have to use that clock (scalar) during the PBO test. In short, the max fit voltage is only good for the settings that you setup PBO for.








	
		
			
				ManofGod said:
			
		
	
	
		
		
			All I can tell you is PBO essentially makes manual overclocking almost pointless. However, if you can figure out per CCX overclocking, then it may be worth it. I have a 3600 and 2 x 3700X's and manually overclocking them really makes no noticeable difference.

Going to CCX overclocking is great but OP needs to go over the basics first like finding his max safe fit voltage or monitoring the cpu, etc etc.

3960x - $59/core, but you're going all the way to 24 cores which would (in my mind at least) double the number of running VMs, vs one more.  Or transcode and game at the same time, etc.  In my mind, of course.   Not sure if that's sane, this is a new market for me, and I'm trying to think it through.  



Motherboards are about the same cost right now; since I won't do anything but a higher-end x570 board.  Crosshair VIII Formula or Meg Ace both end at around $600 right now, the MSI creator is $700.  RAM is the same, cooler is the same, case is the same...  only difference is the CPU."

			HP laptops are junk, I would never consider purchasing one. I get various models of HP Envy branded laptops/AIOs into my repair business fairly frequently for repair and they all generally have the same issue of motherboard failure due to faulty soldering of the BGA parts. Getting parts for the newer models outside of authorized HP channels is pretty ridiculous too, the motherboards are often $300-500.

They've had this problem since the DV series and possibly before, it's hard to believe they keep pumping this crap out.

Most of the time I export video its between 4-4.2GHz. Ambient temps were a bit warmer today and I don't typically do image stabilization in POST as I usually have it turned on in my GoPro settings. Not sure if that process of adding it in post uses instruction sets that require more power/heat or if it was strictly due to it being slightly warmer in the room.

			Ryzen CPUs for AM4 platform rely on external, motherboard sourced telemetry to determine their power consumption. The voltage, current and power telemetry is provided to the processor by the motherboard VRM controller through the AMD SVI2 interface. This information is consumed by the processors power management co-processor, that is responsible for adjusting the operating parameters of the CPU and ensuring, that neither the CPU SKU, platform or infrastructure specific limits are being violated.



The weakness of this method is, that the telemetry essentially uses an undefined scale for the current (and hence power) measurements. This means that the motherboard VRM controller will send an integer between 0 - 255 to the CPU, and based the reference value known by the co-processor firmwares, this integer is converted to a figure, that represents a physical current drawn by the CPU. Based on the accurately known current flow and the voltage, it is possible to calculate to CPU power draw in Watts (V * I).

Get the latest beta and fire up Cinebench and test your board out. Don't forget whatever power draw limits you raised already and undo them.








	
	
		
		
			HWiNFO will display ""Power Reporting Deviation"" metric under the CPUs enhanced sensors. The displayed figure is a percentage, with 100.0% being the completely unbiased baseline. When the motherboard manufacturer has both properly calibrated and declared the reference value, the reported figure should be pretty close to 100% under a stable, near-full-load scenario. A ballpark for a threshold, where the readings become suspicious is around ±5%. So, if you see an average value that is significantly lower than ~ 95% there is most likely intentional biasing going on. Obviously, the figure can be greater than 100%, but for the obvious reasons it rarely is

Also the deviation reporting only applies to full load.

X570 can take another lap.  MSI can run the X570 Tomahawk, gigabyte can tighten up their bios....or not, Asus + ASRock can do whatever.



Ryzen 2 gets a .1 with some increased Shirley quality.  Latency gets the spotlight as the aha for people to sell their X for an XT.

ive never seen intel so down before its lots of fun dont you think LOL 



I got so *tired* of buying a new cpu with a new motherboard every time you had to upgrade or chose to re-install everything spend days tweaking again............Thanks AMD Im happier Now

I'm not defending Intel's actions. They have a tendency to replace their motherboards and chipsets far more than is actually necessary. However, there are positive things that result from that. The people that complain about changing motherboards are often the same people who come into the forum and make threads about replacing their CPU and not being able to flash it, or asking about AMD CPU compatibility, because its not as cut and dry as they thought it would be. These same people also find that there may be additional limitations of memory clocking or that their old budget boards don't support some of the features that the new CPU's do. 



When we are talking about $150 to $200 motherboards, I generally couldn't care less about having to replace the board to get the best possible computing experience and the most out of my new processor. When you are talking about $600+ motherboards, then I think we are well into constant motherboard changes being an issue. Of course, the more expensive motherboards didn't make as many compromises in their designs and using a newer CPU with a high end motherboard that's a generation old often comes with fewer problems. The weird thing is that the people who buy the ultra-cheap motherboards tend to be the ones that don't want to replace their boards. The ones who have the $600+ motherboards are often the ones who will replace it each time there is a new chipset to get the latest features, the best memory clocks, and the best overclocking. 



But when you change motherboards and chipsets each generation, you avoid the pitfalls of requiring an old CPU to even get the system to POST with a newer CPU. You avoid your BIOS ROM being to small to support a broad range of CPU's. You get up to date VRM designs and implementations that generally allow for better overclocking of modern CPU's. You also get the ability to clock RAM higher than you might on the older motherboards with those newer CPU's. Modern power savings features often don't work on legacy motherboards. The list of disadvantages goes on and on. Intel broadly avoids all that crap. If you match up the socket with the CPU you are normally good to go. Intel's had broad socket compatibility in the past and the same problems AMD's platform has were all very much present. It has also had artificially short life spans for chipsets and sockets and occasionally people have found enough evidence to call them out on that. 



You pick your poison, but whether you were tired of buying new motherboards or not, there are plenty of valid reasons to go either direction. Personally, even with AMD's broad socket compatibility I opt for newer motherboards. I've even replaced the motherboard without replacing the CPU in order to gain access to newer platform features when there was something there I wanted. Of course, this was largely back when Intel's CPU's were stagnant and there was far more innovation on the motherboard side. These days CPU's are moving forward again on the AMD side, so it's largely had reasons to upgrade each generation while Intel hasn't."

If the B550's came out last year most would have been buying those instead of B450's and now find out their out of luck going forward.

i'm going to say asmedia probably screwed the pooch on this one.. i think AMD should of just bit the bullet and released their own b550 chipset after asmedia failed to deliver b550 when it was suppose to. but i'm going to guess they already invested to much money into it to just walk away from the contract. i still have a sneaky feeling that we'll end up seeing some b450 and x470 boards supporting zen 3 unofficially by claiming the bios is ""beta"" so then they can pass the blame on the customer when something doesn't work right. was really popular from board partners back during phenom II when a lot of the old am2 boards supported phenom II using a beta bios and there was no point in contacting support for help if you had that bios installed.

			I again warn that it's dangerous to make guesses about the voltage. If you got 60%, that means you or your board is reporting less power draw than what the cpu thinks it should have. Your cpu is not using 2V, thinking like that is way off the mark my man. Again, with you using negative voltage settings YOU are limiting the power consumption to the cpu. Anyone can test this easily by comparing their power deviation at stock vs a negative offset. The negative offset will produce numbers well below 95%.
		
		Click to expand...
	
The 60% number are at 100% stock (aside from RAM XMP), before I changed any numbers in the UEFI.



I'm still reporting a maximum of 1.5V after my crazy lowering of SOC to 1.0 and my offset to -.1

Also I still have a maximum of 4.5ghz + on 6 of my 12 cores, the other 6 show a max of 4.3. Average of all cores over 4+ hours now being around 3.9ghz.

I DO have an active transcoding job on my computer at the moment, so those numbers are not truly idle.



Yet again, if i'm somehow reading this wrong let me know, I've never had a CPU perform like the Ryzen 3000 series is doing so this is all very weird to me.



In the past I figured out a good voltage, a good mhz % overclock and just set it and forget it once i figured out a stable mix of voltage and temperature.

			As a somewhat separate issue, even when using PBO and increasing the power limits to 999W in the bios, I notice on HWinfo that the package power draw never exceeds 90w. Is that the limit for this CPU, no matter what I tell the motherboard to do? This could explain the boosting behavior as well, considering again that temps are always under 70c despite the load. Ambients are good and my intake fans are located next to my AC vent in my office, which is kept at 68f.

			That's only for a single core, the power circuitry is not designed to push that much voltage through all cores, you'll burn it up.  Load up all cores in cinebench with pbo limits set to 999 and see what the chip does, it will not push anywhere near that much voltage on all cores.

When removing the heatsink from the motherboard, somehow the cpu came out of the socket along with the heatsink.  I did not use excessive force in removing the heatsink and am still confused about how this happened.



A few of the tiny gold pins on the cpu were bent as a result.  I assume the pins need to be straightened out in order for the cpu to function, correct?  I believe these pins must fit precisely in to the tiny holes of the motherboard socket.  I sure hope the cpu is not destroyed as it is only 2 weeks old.  Would tweezers be a good tool to use to straighten out the pins?  It looks like just 2 or 3 bent pins on the far edge and close to the corner.



Another problem is that the cpu is stuck to the heatsink.  How can I separate the 2 without damaging the cpu?  I was about to insert a knife in between and pry it off but am having anxiety about further damaging the cpu at this point."

Anyway, I started playing around with the idea of moving from my old dual socket Intel server with two 8C/16T chips, to a single socket 16C/32T EPYC.



Then I started looking around for parts.   Supermicro motherboards seem to exist at somewhat reasonable prices, but EPYC CPU's seem to be going for more than list price everywhere I can find them.



Is there a secret to finding them at the right prices, or is there a shortage, and this is just the way it is?

I swear ian missed the forest from the trees. This is a serious issue in the context that if you didn't know about it and think your cpu is doing what it's supposed to be doing. And then you go to overclock like the majority of users who don't read or research anbd they end up jacking PBO up or running random manual voltages. That's a recipe for issues. And Ian's also wrong about degradation as it can happen at mild voltages under typical cooling. Stilt's shown this and he's been hunting for that missing power envelope for a year now.



Threads like this lead ppl down a bad ending and it only gets worse if the board at the outset is lying to the cpu.

Right, there's only a 20-25% ipc difference between Skylake/Zen 2 generation and Nehalem.  Its mostly been clock speeds holding it back.



Workloads that better-utilize the AVX2 units would make more of a difference, but video encoding is tough to vectorize.  The workload i also not very memory bandwidth-intensive (so DDR4 makes no difference)

			The key to the speed boost of the 3300x is that there's a single CCX in the CPU, which has a significant impact on reducing latency between cores. GN found that it makes up to a 20% difference clock for clock versus the 3100.




	
		
	


Whether the 3300x is faster than a 3600x comes down not to clock rates but whether a game can use more cores. If you watch the GN video you'll see their examples of this in action. Also, it is quite an exaggeration to say a 7700k is way faster. Even at 5.1GHz there's at best a small advantage over a 3300x at stock speeds. In many cases they are effectively equivalent.



This is actually why this chip is a 7700k killer. It has the same core and thread count, and better IPC. In games where more cores matter then neither of these CPUs is in the top tier. Note that people with a 7700k shouldn't sell their chip and run out and buy a 3300x. It is just that anyone looking for performance in that tier now has a no-brainer option. Just buy the 3300x and call it a day. Used 7700k chips should now have a value of less than $100.

A friend is on a 4690.  I told him about the 3300x was: It's not a $120 upgrade, it's more like $400 for new mb & ram (he's on haswell).  He has an RX580 @ 1080p.  I'm guessing he probably isnt' cpu limited yet..."

AMD 386DX40 (with Cyrix x87 FPU) > AMD486 DX4 100 > AMD DX4 133 (5x86 P75 i believe it was named) > Cyrix 6x86 P166+ > AMD K6 200 > AMD K6-2 300 > AMD K6-3 450 > AMD Athlon 500 > AMD Athlon (Thunderbird) 1.33Ghz > Athlon X2 3800+ > Phenom X4 2.3(?) GHz > Phenom II 940 3Ghz > FX 8150 > Ryzen 1700 > Ryzen 3900X



I probably forgot a few along the way 



Most of these systems after the DX4 100 were overclocked.



The Cyrix was sadly not a good CPU. It would have been good with a third player in the x86 CPU market, but that was not to be.



I remember the K6-3 450 as a very good CPU, except for the slower FPU. The on-die L2 (first time on x86 AFAIR) made the motherboard cache into an L3 cache, and its performance (integer IPC) was good. It didn't OC very well though. It was a drop in replacement for K6-2 300.



The Athlon 500 lived most of its life OC'ed to 850Mhz. Very easy OC, if you had a golden fingers device. And faster than anything Intel had at the time.



The first Phenom was not a paticularly good CPU, and would not OC very well. Phenom II was better and would OC to 3.4GHz.



The FX8150 ran at 4.5Ghz most of the time, and I had it for many years, basically waiting for AMD to become competitive again. The Bulldozer architecture was so promising on paper, but turned out a major disapointment ...



Almost immediately that Ryzen was released, I got a 1700, that I ran at 3.75 Ghz most of the time. The first mainboard B350 sadly died, so was replaced by a B450 model. The 1700 was replaced with the 3900X on the same motherboard but with clocks on auto this time.



I have had no intel desktop setups, but my current laptop is Intel based.



At first I bought AMD mostly for the price / performance. I didn't have anything against Intel as such, their products were often just not as apealing to me because of higher prices.



But around the Athlon times, when Intel was playing dirty, basically forcing manufacturers to not use AMD, I became an AMD supporter, and has been ever since. I will avoid buying an Intel CPU if at all possible.



My Intel based laptop is the exception to that rule, my old AMD based laptop was dying, so I bought a second hand laptop that was Intel based.

My next one will be AMD again

The ""Minimum processor state"" in the power plan was set to 90% by default, lowered it to 20% but nothing changed.

The exhaust fan came with the case, not sure about the exact model but it's probably pretty generic. The intake fan is MASTERFAN MF120R RGB. Instead of placing them both as intake at the front, do you think it can be a good idea to place the exhaust one as an intake -but on the top? So it will blow directly towards the CPU. The case has a dust filter there.

			Problem is glaringly obvious, the cooler. Low profile cheap aluminum only blow down coolers are junk, you're not going to ever get good temps with them. I'll give AMD credit for using a slightly better fan than Intel, but the light and cheap extruded aluminum is still the limiting factor.



Quite literally any cooler with heatpipes will be better than that cooler, whether it be blowdown or tower. My go to cooler is a Hyper 212 plus or evo, but other coolers like the Deep Cool GAMMAXX 400, Zalman CNPS5X and Cooler Master Hyper TX3 are fine too.

I really hope that's the problem and nothing more serious. I would get an aftermarket cooler but I kinda spent all my budget on the PC so I'll have to wait until the next month. I'm looking at  Cooler Master Hyper 212 RGB Black Edition."

			I've been out of the game for awhile (checkout my signature for my current rig) and holy s**t a lot has changed.  HardOCP only lives on in forum form and the last AMD CPU I owned was a Clawhammer FX-53 that I cooled with a Koolance Exos (remember those?). So I find myself back in HardForum to get some advice/feedback on moving forward with a new build.  I can potentially push my budget up to $3000 should there be a very convincing reason to (one of the other things that has changed since I built this rig was getting married, so I can't go ham on parts like I used to lol).



I'm considering upgrading because of Coronavirus having (most of) us stay at home and finding that my ancient setup simply cannot keep up with most recently released games (the best I can do is Civ 6 and the recent HALO remasters) and also needing (wanting) a better optimized setup to run the programs I need to finish my degree (ArcGIS Pro and others).  So I decided to reuse some of the components in my current rig in order to maximize the dollars spent on the fun stuff.  Which means I plan on reusing my existing 800D chassis, the EK 360 rad and D5 pump/reservoir setup, and my AX1200i PSU, all of which have performed absolutely flawlessly over the last decade and only now is my case showing its age a bit.  My current monitor is a 24"" 144hz 1080p which I would love to replace with a widescreen 1440 or perhaps 4k in the future.





Here is what I have put together so far:

CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3950X 3.5 GHz 16-Core Processor  ($719.99 @ Amazon)

Motherboard: Asus ROG Crosshair VIII Hero (WI-FI) ATX AM4 Motherboard  ($379.99 @ Newegg)

Memory: Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3200 Memory  ($197.99 @ Amazon)

In the past when I've built new rigs I've gone all out so it's been a challenge not choosing every top of the line part out there and sticking to a budget.  I'm a little brand loyal but when their components have lasted 10+ years it's hard to argue against.



You probably noticed I don't have any type of cooler in there.  That's where the EK-Quantum Momentum ROG Crosshair VIII Hero D-RGB comes in along with an additional EK 120mm radiator to the cooling loop.  So factor in about $250-300 for those items along with the required fittings, tubing etc. I go back and forth a lot on 3950x vs 3900x as well as spending the extra $$$ and getting a 2080 super instead of the 2070.  Also, I considered going with CL 14 memory but its double the cost of the ones I have on the list, from what I understand Zen 2 likes ram speed and CL isn't as important/worth the extra cost? (I could be wrong)



My biggest concern is the fact that Zen 3 is coming towards the end of 2020 in addition to Big Navi.  Waiting feels like the best choice in the long term since I've already gone 10 years so whats another 6-7 months?



But the age of my current rig has REALLY started to show and it's hard not to pull the trigger on something right now (especially since Asus X570 finally restocked today on newegg) and since I will be finding myself spending almost all of my time at home for potentially the rest of 2020, I'd like to maximize my enjoyment while I'm here.



I'm also not planning to upgrade the new rig since my other hobby (offroading/overlanding) usually takes up most of my time and money and I'll soon have kids and a mortgage to worry about along with the cost of living in California.  For now I just want something that can play the latest games and perhaps a few titles of the future and be my ArcGIS/productivity workstation.  Ideally I'd like the rig to hopefully last 5+ years knowing that over time I will have to lower settings on games to keep acceptable FPS.



Would you wait for the next hardware release? Do you think reusing parts of my now 10 year old rig isn't a good idea?  What other parts would you choose? Should I watercool the GPU as well?  Are you tired of getting asked the same upgrade questions 1892372 different ways?



Thanks in advance!

Looks looks super solid dude.



Keep an eye on the buildapcsales subreddit. I always see 2070 supers going for ~ 475 and have seen 2080 supers for ~625.



New parts coming out will not make your parts obsolete if you buy today, you can always use it for a bit and sell and drop in upgrade to ryzen 4000 if you really want to. You'll likely be able to recoup a good chunk of your cpu investment (50-75%, so you'll lose $200?) and you get to enjoy a new rig during corona time (~6-10 months?)



Edit: Just saw you're going with a cheaper setup. Still super solid and likely will see no discernable difference. Keep an eye out on above subreddit as you will often find 5700xt's dipping into the 350-375 range. Keep in mind if you get an x570 or B550 board today you will be able to drop in a ryzen 4000 series in the future.

			Sounds like the OP is doing video library stuff rather then live streaming.  I keep a video library and shoot for smallest file size with highest quality.  Software encoding does the best there, but also takes longer.  The hardware encoders specialize in speed at the cost of some quality and file size, ideal for live streaming.



I haven't tried the latest nVidia encoder since I have a GTX 1660 and the latest one is only included with the RTX series, but at this point I get the best results for library stuff with software encoding which is CPU intensive.  Both AMD and Intel CPUs have hardware encoders, but they have the same pros and cons as the nVidia hardware encoder.  They say the nVidia encoder is the best one as far as hardware encoders go.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Have a TON of experience with the Nvidia one from a vGPU perspective; it's amazing, but it's shooting for (as you said) a balance of speed vs quality, and in general, speed is the priority (since it's effectively live-streaming a desktop).  You're correct, I'm encoding for a massive video library and for archival purposes of certain things, and I'm going for the highest quality possible while still being a reasonable file size (I'm not even trying for smallest; storage is cheap), which ends up being CPU.  That normally locks down a system for as long as it takes to encode, and I'd like to be able to keep doing real things while it's working on that.    



I do plan on using NVENC on the resulting media server - when you're transcoding to a destination, speed again becomes the priority - but the higher the quality the source, the more options it has to work with and the higher the quality the output."

			tbh it doesn't really matter if you're using zen 2 (zen 1/1+ might be a little more picky), the IMC on those chips has been tuned specifically for daisy chain which most of the boards have except for some of the 300 series boards and maybe the asus CH7 if i remember correctly so you shouldn't have issues running 4x8 up to at least 3600, possibly higher. 4x16 might require a slightly higher SOC voltage to go up to 3600 but should work on any mid range/high end board. the easy way to check with your board is look on the QVL list and see what clock speeds they're showing for 4x8 configurations, then that should give you an idea if you'll be able to run 4x8 above 2933(doesn't mean you need to grab specific memory that's on the QVL though since they rarely ever get updated after launch). so if that looks good go with what ever option is available to you that has the better clock speeds/timing for the price.

Core counts matter, but the rest, not so much.  Thinking it through still - there's a tipping point.  8 cores lets me run a simulation like I have since Bulldozer came out (massively chopped down versions of the workloads, except the core storage one that takes the 6).  12 cores would let me run one ""real"" worker (8c instead of 6), and the front-end stuff.  16 cores would let me add another front-end server for those, but that's about it - can't fit two workers with that (they're each 8 cores/16G of ram, 100% reserved on the memory since they're simulating an NVDIMM).  24 cores though, that would get me to a full 3 workers (full minimal deployment), although I'd need 48G of memory for it.  I could fake the front end stuff then...  To really get it all up and going, I'd need more like 32 actual physical cores (8x3 for the workers, 6 for front-end, 2 for the rest of the system) but that way lies madness - the 3970X is more than I really want to spend on this - I'd be better off trying to track down physical hardware at that point.  



I still think you all are right - this is infrequent enough that the simulation is fine, and 12 or 16 cores would still let me run a single full-scale worker if I needed to (the hack to simulate an NVDIMM also works to let you ignore the requirement for 3 workers), and 64G of ram gives me breathing room."

No, that could degrade in a month. Maximum fit voltage for high current loads is 1.325v, though actual is always dependent upon individual silicon. Max voltage for low current loads is 1.5v. High current = all core situations where all cores are loaded. Low current = single threaded situations."

			It really depends on the game. I put this theory to the test when I reviewed the Intel Core i9-10900K. What you said is mostly true, except in specific scenarios. Destiny 2 as an example shows greater gaps than 5% across the spectrum of CPU's we tested. Shadow of the Tomb Raider shows slightly more than 5% gains going from the 9900K to the 10900K and again when the 10900K is overclocked to 5.1GHz on all cores. Hitman 2 showed vastly different minimum frame rates at 4K across our test systems despite having almost identical averages. The maximum FPS numbers were also a bit more spread out than 5% comparing the 3900X to the Intel CPU's.



However, Ghost Recon backs up what you said 100%. It is most certainly entirely GPU limited as the RTX 2080 Super I used showed a 1-3 FPS range from best to worst across all the CPU's we tested. That's pretty much margin of error territory. Given the time we had to complete the review, the CPU tests weren't as broad as we would have liked, but we still saw more than a 5% difference at 4K in some of our tests. I know we'd get more varied results with a few other CPU's thrown into the mix with different clocks and core counts as I've seen that before. These differences are certainly much larger at more CPU limited resolutions, but they still exist across the spectrum.



Your GPU matters more, but saying that you are almost entirely GPU limited at 4K simply isn't an accurate statement. There are enough cases where we can demonstrate a larger difference to show this. The GPU being the bigger factor doesn't equate to the CPU being largely unimportant. However, if you only look at averages, they are broadly the same for most CPU's. Back when the Ryzen 3000 series launched, I tested the 3900X against a Threadripper 2920X which had the same core/thread count. The averages often said they were the same, but the minimum and maximum FPS were very different across the board. Unfortunately, we didn't do 4K testing back then as I didn't have a 4K monitor on the test bench. We were also limited on time as CPU launches tend to give us almost no time to work.



The point being, I've done enough testing to know that the GPU is still the best place to put the bulk of your budget in a gaming PC build, but a higher end CPU is certainly worth it for 4K gaming if you can afford it.

but you are testing 9900k,10900k, and 3900X those are all top of the line procs!   you can't say procs dont' make a difference what about 4930k or 2600k or a FX-6300 in the mix if the processor doesn't matter.  Plus you are most likely testing games that were coded to run on an Xbox or PS4 where the game engine is designed to run on jaguar cores anyway.   then you're saying well the biggest difference was minimum frames.  yeah  because the games prob felt like they were stuttering and frametimes were all over the place especially when lots of stuff was going on at the same time.  Wait till some of the next gen games drop and start telling me your little puny intel quad is gonna keep up with the big boys.   Really kinda just upsets me to see people recommending that others to get bottom end, minimum spec processors for gaming rigs which in turn will turn people off of PC gaming in the future becuase their rigs run like shit when new games come out.   I mean yeah if all you want to do is play counterstrike: source.  then yeah  go ahead and build you an I7 920 rig and be happy.   but look think about you're posting at?..  ..this is [H]ard OCP son!   GO [H]ard or GO {h}ome.  we ain't about a bunch of panzy @$$ pentiums round here!   and think about it, if you build a system with a solid enough backbone, you can always keep it going a few years and just upgrade the GPU instead of having to build a whole new rig.  so keep that in mind too.



p.s.  funny the guy w/ the 10900k is telling everyone else to get a weaker proc.  thats some sewer tactics, bro.



and kids.  really if you really want to make a system last and you are on a budget...  you don't need 4K on a little dinky monitor that's sitting 3ft from your face...   but that's a whole nother topic.  ...but if you got a few grand to blow on a new rig every year, more power to ya.  just trying to look out for the working man."

Hmm, by your RM screen, the two gold stars are your fastest cores, white stars are your second best. The limit with this is that we can only overclock by the whole CCX at a time, which is 3 cores at once. As you say if CCX2 (CCD0/CCX1) is your best then set that ratio to 45 and everything else to 43. If you can pull that off at 1.3v that is pretty darn good. Btw, I only use RM to see which cores are starred. In my experience it doesn't equate to highest overclocking core. It doesn't match up with yours either it seems, but no biggie."

I did a more standard ""stress"" test with AVX2 and it showed 103%.



So my understanding of this number based on the Tech Jesus video and looking back in the actual thread over at the HWInfo forums is that the reported power draw is 103% of the actual power draw meaning that I'm actually drawing some 3% less than reported (which is a confusing way to phrase what they are after).  When they showed an early ASRock bios (in the Tech Jesus video) and the number was somewhere in the 80% range, it's saying that the reported power draw was only 80% of the actual power draw meaning that it's drawing some 25% more than it should.

			As a somewhat separate issue, I notice on HWinfo that no matter what I change my settings to in the bios, the package power draw never exceeds 90w. Is that the limit for this CPU, no matter what I tell the motherboard to do? This could explain the boosting behavior as well, considering again that temps are always under 70c despite the load. Ambients are good and my intake fans are located next to my AC vent in my office, which is kept at 68f.

You may want to check for newer firmware versions for that motherboard. I have that same ASUS board in use as a router and server, and earlier firmware versions did have weird issues.

I hope to all it all back together by late Monday or Tuesday and will do more testing then.

			I don't see any point in an extended warranty from the OEM themselves. Often times if something breaks, they just replace it with the same defective part that lasts nearly the same amount of time and breaks again, just this time out of the extended warranty period and you're SOL. The DV 6000/9000 models were notorious for this, I repaired this one DV9000 for a customer three times because HP kept sending replacement boards with the exact same defect.



Extended warranties used to be about ""what ifs"", but now they're about letting the manufacturer build products ever cheaper and ever more disposable.

Intel and AMD are both viable options for upgrades
You will get more bang for buck in productivity with AMD
Suitable AMD upgrades are 3700x,3800x, 3900x, 3950x
Suitable intel upgrades are 9900k, 10700k, 10900k
AMD is more picky about memory/memory speeds
Intel is more picky about motherboard VRMs if overclocking, and don’t come with heatsinks.
Either way, you will need to spend more in one area (memory or motherboard/heatsink)
More cores is not necessary for gaming
More speed helps gaming
Intel’s AVX2 implementation is better than AMDs at this time
AMD has more cores at this time, helpful for video
You need to decide which is better based on what you do. If it is 60/40 gaming/video, I would lean AMD, if it is 90/10 or 80/20 I would lean intel. At 70/30 it is a bit of a wash.

			So are you saying the 3300x is going to be faster than the 3600x and 3950x at gaming? Because the 7700k OC'd quite often is which is why I posted it.
		
		Click to expand...
	
The key to the speed boost of the 3300x is that there's a single CCX in the CPU, which has a significant impact on reducing latency between cores. GN found that it makes up to a 20% difference clock for clock versus the 3100.




	
		
	


Whether the 3300x is faster than a 3600x comes down not to clock rates but whether a game can use more cores. If you watch the GN video you'll see their examples of this in action. Also, it is quite an exaggeration to say a 7700k is way faster. Even at 5.1GHz there's at best a small advantage over a 3300x at stock speeds. In many cases they are effectively equivalent.



This is actually why this chip is a 7700k killer. It has the same core and thread count, and better IPC. In games where more cores matter then neither of these CPUs is in the top tier. Note that people with a 7700k shouldn't sell their chip and run out and buy a 3300x. It is just that anyone looking for performance in that tier now has a no-brainer option.

			Well that's true. Going from a 4690 to a 3300x is not a $120 upgrade. If your friend sold his 4690 / mobo / ram and purchased a B450 based mobo and 16GB of DDR4-3200 value ram the total upgrade cost could easily be less than $200, though. It would cost maybe $300ish out of pocket for the new combo, less whatever they can get for the old combo. I think it is an upgrade worth considering. Gaming improvements at 1080p with an RX 580 may or may not be noticeable depending on your friend's display refresh rate and game selection, but literally everything your friend does on their computer will be and feel faster. I felt noticeable gains going from a 1600x to a 3600, so coming from haswell the difference should be even bigger.



That said, there is a compelling reason to consider holding off on an upgrade right now. We're not too far from DDR5 platforms according to rumors. Zen 4 may support it, and Samsung is allegedly gearing up for mass production of it in 2021. From that perspective it doesn't make a lot of sense to get into a DDR4 platform while it is nearing EOL as the mainstream best option. I had a 2500k I was content with and planned to continue using it, skipping DDR4 entirely and going straight to DDR5. The issue was my motherboard died so I was forced to upgrade. A 4690 is still a viable gaming cpu at 1080p these days, as is a 2500k really (caveats assumed that not all games run really well and details may have to be turned down, but they'll generally play ok enough).

The parts are literally $275, so I agree it could be $200 if he sells his stuff for $75.  If he's upgrading to an equivelent intel CPU, it's going to be at least that much too.  He couild upgrade to a used 7700k and pay $200 just for the CPU plus another $100 for a used Z170 board and still need ram (and have all used parts)... not sure how that makes any more sense.  I do agree, any upgrade to a new platform is more than just the CPU but that isn't an AMD thing... it's an if you want to upgrade from an old platform thing."

			What are you doing with that thing?  I have 2x L5640's (6/12 each) with 96GB of registered ECC and it barely ever breaks a sweat .

Anyways, just making a post and listening in for some suggestions because you never know .  That link to servethehome has a few lower priced deals.  Finding 'upgrades' isn't a half bad idea, they are the same damn chip, lol, they just call it an upgrade for one of their systems.

Maybe you are gods gift to virtualisation. Pretty big board though so it’s a bit presumptive. I know there is an AWS level 7 from ec2 product team for example. I’ve done VMware since 2005, had vExpert, have done kvm for years but I honestly don’t know what he’s talking about if he gets on that shit.



Anyway, don’t really know what you’re doing, it looks like you’ve got some pretty niche stuff. I’d have thought those would guide you anyway, demoing nvmeof I’d assume you use nvme pass through on a guest and just map it as a target through a vswitch. Point being drive for that, drive for your vms (make sure you need nvme) If you had graphics in there too you’re gonna be pushing it on lanes so maybe headroom does make sense



ECC works fine with threadripper btw, just depends on degree of critically whether it’s worth it. Farm machines we use it as a job can take more than 24 hours and one app in particular is a single context, non-distributable monstrosity. Bit slower vs losing a day is an easy calculation



Standard workstations we don’t. Just test them when they come in and if someone gets a crash they’ll lose nominal time unless they’ve been stupid.



It sounds like you want someone to say yes, (we’ve all been there), speaking for myself I went with it for home PC (am waiting for my water block)



For me I know I’m right on the borderline of it making sense and the stuff running is pretty...hefty



Host

Gaming VM

Multiple windows client vms (otherwise pita when you have logins for lots of companies)

K8s Cluster (utilities, maven cache, remote development containers etc)

Pytorch w/gpu

Database server, uses 90gb of ram. Fuck you very much jvm.



I already know 16 cores is enough for that as I don’t use everything together, 4:1 ratios are fine as my workflow doesn’t drive contention and I just switch shit off if I need to run ‘big’ and don’t want the cpu queue issues that big vms cause.  Plus big stuff can just take a bit longer if needed. I need 128gb, 32gb dimms get me there,  I need 10gbe which is a factor but solvable on an x570.



In the end it just came down to the fact I’m buying this for a 5 year machine and want a single box to replace a couple, plus I’m pretty sure I’ll hit the lane limit on Ryzen by the time I get the updated optane etc. Supported by the fact that whilst I’m not one to spend needlessly, it’s not a problematic amount of money.



Of course my real preference would be to not have shit internet so I could just pay a few bucks an hour for the times I need most of that 



We can rationalise anything to ourselves with time but Threadripper very much does not make sense for almost everyone. There’s no getting round that. Its basically “do you earn money from it”, and then “does it make you more money”, if answer is no, you don’t need it. You just want it, which is good and what [H] is about but it’s not rational.



So if you want it, go for it. If you’re still not sure, flip a coin. If you’re disappointed with the answer then you’ll know."

As for why I chose AMD.  It was all about what I could get for the money I wanted to spend at the time.  Then it progressed into me spending even more money since I then upgrade AMD CPU's around 6 months after I first built the rig.  Went from a 2600 to a 3900x.  Then I wanted a better MB so I upgraded that.  Did I need to, no, but I wanted to.  When the 4000 series comes out I  will most likely upgrade the chip again, not the MB because I am happy with that.  But in this case at least I can just buy a new CPU and use everything else I already have, unlike Intel where I would need a new board as well.  Which would lead to me probably buying other crap because, why not I already have to remove everything and install it again.

I'm simply pointing out that AMD wants money just like Intel does. This was in response to a post which implied that Intel was too expensive and therefore greedy.

As per the previous comment from Dan_D.  I buy cheap mothersboards for my kids builds.  They are playing minecraft.  If I can re-use it for an upgrade, that means I can spend more on the GPU or CPU.  If I have to spend more $ on the MB, then that's less budget I can spend on the components.  I feel if you have the money to keep replaceing $600 motherboards, the frustration of having to flash a bios is probably not worth your time.  When your entire budget for a build is $600, you stretch every penny.  I've got a B450 MB and full intend to upgrade the CPU when the new 4000 series comes out.  I don't care for PCIE 4.0 for my desktop.  Unless the B550 comes out at a really low price point I see no reason to upgrade.

Looks like a fast 4c8t cpu can still get it done for a while longer yet.  For me these are interesting for general computing use, HTPC, upgrading an already ultra budget AM4 board with a first gen Ryzen quad, or setting up a new system on AM4 with the mind to eventually move to the 3900x or 3950x.



Still , personally, I feel that a 6c12t cpu is really the budget sweet spot and will last longer. These R3s are punchy and interesting but I’m not feeling it at even $120.

I think there's a lot to this. At the time I bought my 3600 the local Microcenter still had a ton of B350 and x370 boards in stock. I was pretty shocked since the 400 series launched with Zen+. There were some massive discounts on the 300 series boards to clear them out at that point. I snagged a second B350 Tomahawk for a whopping $9 after the CPU / mobo combo discount. Even at the asking price of $59 for the board it was a steal IMO. (A handed down 1600, a $9 B350 Tomahawk and 16GB of DDR4-2800 by OLOy I got for $42 makes for a bangin' plex server on the cheap.)



Since there was an ample supply of both B350 and B450 boards at the launch of Zen 2 I can totally understand why B550 was not released. It is kind of strange that the demand for Zen+ and Zen 2 CPUs seems to exceed the demand for socket AM4 boards."

I built a 3970x production rig last fall and that build added up to 8K before the gpus. It's a media production machine and was built to support that. I tried to stretch the funds as best as possible but still there's no avoiding the large cost multiplier of TR. And the other thing with TR is that if you're not using up those lanes... you're not maximizing use of that platform. And thus we made sure to use up them lanes with the storage system with an 8TB gen 4 nvme RAID 0 array, bucko bucks. 15GB/s read and write on the array is insane. Add cooling, blocks, rads, pump, etc etc and it rung out to 8K. And then we added another 64gb of B-dies... smh. The cost multipliers with TR is just really stupid high.

			Parting out my current rig to build something new. The dimm 1 slot stopped working on my x99 setup. Just sold off the dual 1080 GTXs I had on water today. So I’m ordering a new CPU and Motherboard this week, as well as a new cpu water block. Current rig I have a 5820k @ 4.5ghz all cores , been at that for last 3 years. I have dual 360mm rads in my case with 6 Corsair ML fans. So I’m trying to decide what CPU to get. It will be Over clocked and on water. It will only be used for gaming and I’ll be getting a 3080ti when they drop to go along with it. Price really isn’t an issue as it’s only 200 bucks between bottom and top. But also don’t want to waste money either. I have built a few 3800x systems for my customers and they seam really snappy. I haven’t had the pleasure of over clocking any yet however. I figure any of them will kill my old 5820k pretty easy even at stock speeds. Also planed to use the 3200 memory I was using from that build. Will that hold me back? When over clocking? I would like this to last me another 3 years like the last build. Also I’ll be gaming mostly at 4k. Picking up the new LG 48inch oled. Attached picture of current setup. Thanks for any input

Zen 2 CPUs are pretty good with different memory modules, gets more tricky with 4 dims installed but I got 4 dims (4 x 8gb) running at 3800mhz on a X370 motherboard with a 3900x, tested 2 x 16gb Hynix dram dims at XMP rated speed of 3466mhz without too much issue. So your ram should be good to go with maybe some adjustments.



I am on my fourth CPU on my ASUS motherboard, upgrades are easy and like magic. Since Zen 3 is most likely coming out in the next 6 - 9 months, you might want to just play around with a 3600x or 3700x and snag a high end Zen 3 later.



Then again Threadripper would be one potent combo if you can use a lot of PCIe slots."

			May I ask what version of HWMonitor you're using? Because the clocks tab looks different than mine. Is it because of the motherboard? Also, look at my clock speeds, they're much higher than yours and I'm not doing anything except browsing this forum.

I'd think something is wrong with the C-States in the firmware, like they're not turned on. Or AMD Cool'n'Quiet isn't enabled if the lowest clock you're getting is 2500 MHz.



You may want to check for newer firmware versions for that motherboard. I have that same ASUS board in use as a router and server, and earlier firmware versions did have weird issues."

Ran Shadow of the Tomb Raider as a benchmark....

I ran 1080P most settings maxed (no HBAO or Motion Blur) in the following speed / timings:

3200 XMP / XMP @ 1900 Infinity Fabric / 3600 14-19-16 / 3800 15-20-17 / 3600 - subtimings tuned / 3800 - subtimings tuned

AVG FPS (multiple runs, averaged, rounded to nearest 0.5FPS):

125.0 / 125.5 / 132.5 / 133.5 / 139.5 / 141.0

5% low FPS:

95.5 / 95.0 / 99.5 / 100.5 / 106.0 / 107.0

This is some seriously Pro work.  

5% gains in that game by no change other than tighter subtimings is nothing to sneeze at.



Here are a few other games that saw significant gains:

The bottom 2 bars are $70 T-Force Dark.  The middle 3 are $130 g.skill flareX and the top 2 are $170 g.skill Neo.  Both the Dark and Neo were given tweaks.  Both saw 5% gains on avg fps and 10-15% boost to 1% lows.



An earlier test showed a stock 3900x at 166/219 fps (similar to 3200c14 above) while the 5 ghz 9900k maxed out at 170/228 fps.



https://www.techspot.com/review/1877-core-i9-9900k-vs-ryzen-9-3900x/



Assasin's Creed was even more impressive and tangible with the lower overall fps marks:

Although not the same settings, you can easily extrapolate and see how a 3900x could blow past even a 5.0 ghz 9900k in this game:

AMD will in a way be competing with themselves as well.  First with the 3200g/3400g, while they are only Zen+, do offer an iGPU which may be more attractive to budget general PC users.

I guess, on balance, the most difficult part of all this is the realization that so many players out there are taking the opportunity to hoodwink buyers into believing they're getting prime parts.  As a crook, there's really nothing to cleaning up an old, scrapped processor with a little alcohol and passing it off to some hapless soul.  However, haste and sloppiness seems to tip the hand here -- with traces of aged heat sink compound and sticker residue -- along with a side of bent pins here and there.  Integrity, anyone?!?



FWIW, safety definitely plays a part in the reasoning behind keeping this old equipment alive.  Value, too: Over 30K hours on the old Turion and still counting!  So, it looks like I'll be taking a gander at the higher-end obsolete semiconductor world to see what might be about; and I'll come on back with anything noteworthy to share 



Meantime, I believe resourcefulness will be the word for the day; as I'll also be keeping an eye peeled here-and-there for something which is verifiably NOS and bound by a robust return policy.

			A friend is on a 4690.  I told him about the 3300x was: It's not a $120 upgrade, it's more like $400 for new mb & ram (he's on haswell).  He has an RX580 @ 1080p.  I'm guessing he probably isnt' cpu limited yet...
		
		Click to expand...
	
Well that's true. Going from a 4690 to a 3300x is not a $120 upgrade. If your friend sold his 4690 / mobo / ram and purchased a B450 based mobo and 16GB of DDR4-3200 value ram the total upgrade cost could easily be less than $200, though. It would cost maybe $300ish out of pocket for the new combo, less whatever they can get for the old combo. I think it is an upgrade worth considering. Gaming improvements at 1080p with an RX 580 may or may not be noticeable depending on your friend's display refresh rate and game selection, but literally everything your friend does on their computer will be and feel faster. I felt noticeable gains going from a 1600x to a 3600, so coming from haswell the difference should be even bigger.



That said, there is a compelling reason to consider holding off on an upgrade right now. We're not too far from DDR5 platforms according to rumors. Zen 4 may support it, and Samsung is allegedly gearing up for mass production of it in 2021. From that perspective it doesn't make a lot of sense to get into a DDR4 platform while it is nearing EOL as the mainstream best option. I had a 2500k I was content with and planned to continue using it, skipping DDR4 entirely and going straight to DDR5. The issue was my motherboard died so I was forced to upgrade. A 4690 is still a viable gaming cpu at 1080p these days, as is a 2500k really (caveats assumed that not all games run really well and details may have to be turned down, but they'll generally play ok enough)."

			I live in GA and its probably more humid than the pacific nw. If your indoor RH is 71% with the AC on your AC is probably too small for your house. You might want to put a dehumidifier in your computer room or upsize your central HVAC unit.



Im running a ton too large in my home and it gets my RH down to 35% when the outside can be 100%. My water pump is constantly running every 15 mins full tank under my AC unit downstairs.



Of course the house came with this oversized AC when I bought it so I am not talking as if I am an authority on it. Just what I have noticed with this really large unit I have.
		
		Click to expand...
	


I moved from the mid Atlantic, so 100% humidity year round was the norm for the first 34 years of my life. 



Here in the PNW nothing, even new construction here has central AC (at least on the coast like we are).  I have a 9000 BTU portable AC that I use in the living room, but if the temperature is within 3F of the ""set temperature"" then it mainly runs on fan mode since they use a small high efficiency compressor and a very small drain tank since they normally dump the water vapor back into he cold coils to increase efficiency even more.



Last summer was fine, it rarely got above 65-68C with 35-50% humidity (without the AC running) but this year it has been extremely humid here with outdoor humidity reaching 85-95%...



I truly miss central AC.  I had considered buying a whole house humidifier but the problem is one of storage.  We have a 1100 sq ft apartment and the way it is laid out makes it hard  since the back of the house (living room/dining room/kitchen) gets full sun (when we get it lol) during the morning and the front of the building (where both bedrooms are) get blasted by sun for the last 10 hours of the day making them super hot).



We have another one of the portable ACs in the bedroom but I do not run that during the day, just usually turn it on about 30 mins before bed and it runs as needed at night."

(I hope).  If I'm right, Tdie is the actual temp.  Tctl is used to keep the fans ahead of the heat curve. With no over clocks, I shouldn't have any issues. (but I do) Now stuff gets weird.



My understanding is that at 68C the 1950X will start throttling. The catch is that my Tdie temps go above 68C during prime95, and the system does not throttle. Again, I'm talking about the Tdie temp here. Out of fear, I have always stoped prime95 when the Tdie gets to 75C (the system is still running at the the all core boost of 3.7 ghz).  Am I missunderstanding what I am seeing, or is something wrong?

As the OP stated, no MC nearby. What's more, the X570 chipset does not support any of the Bulldozer-derivative APUs at all (all Excavator-based AM4 CPUs are actually APUs with their IGPs disabled during manufacture). So the Excavator core APU will not work at all with any X570 motherboard even though the CPU physically fits the motherboard's socket. Excavator is only compatible with the 300- and 400-series motherboards whose BIOS version has not yet been updated to a Zen2-compatible version (in other words, the BIOS version must specifically support the original first-generation Zen CPUs in order to be compatible with Excavator). That same compatibility issue will greatly complicate a BIOS update to support Zen2 and newer CPUs: Some motherboards will not even let you update to a Zen2-compatible BIOS version (or more specifically, the BIOS update attempt to the newer BIOS version will fail) with an Excavator or a Zen1 CPU installed.

			I've run 3900X's and 3950X's on all kinds of motherboards across the entire price spectrum. You should be fine unless you plan on doing heavily multi-threaded workloads or you are overclocking to any real degree. If you start that, you really want to make sure you upgrade to something with a decent VRM if you want it to last. It might last on a cheap board. Sometimes they'll surprise you, but I would upgrade for piece of mind if I was running a cheap X370 board.







No, it's not the same. It's not even close. The power consumption, TDP ratings and core counts are quite a bit lower than a 3900X or 3950X. The demand on the VRM's are vastly different as a result of that.

I is not as significantly different as you make it out to be. (Meaning, it is not a night and day difference, is what I am thinking.)  Also, I have an Asrock mainboard and he is of the lesser model. Any information is helpful, even though it is not the exact same setup.

I read the instructions that came with the Ryzen 5 3600 cpu purchase.  They did not mention anything about twisting the heatsink to manage this problem.

			At 4K, you are almost entirely GPU limited. CPU-to-CPU variance would be less than 5%
		
		Click to expand...
	
It really depends on the game. I put this theory to the test when I reviewed the Intel Core i9-10900K. What you said is mostly true, except in specific scenarios. Destiny 2 as an example shows greater gaps than 5% across the spectrum of CPU's we tested. Shadow of the Tomb Raider shows slightly more than 5% gains going from the 9900K to the 10900K and again when the 10900K is overclocked to 5.1GHz on all cores. Hitman 2 showed vastly different minimum frame rates at 4K across our test systems despite having almost identical averages. The maximum FPS numbers were also a bit more spread out than 5% comparing the 3900X to the Intel CPU's. 



However, Ghost Recon backs up what you said 100%. It is most certainly entirely GPU limited as the RTX 2080 Super I used showed a 1-3 FPS range from best to worst across all the CPU's we tested. That's pretty much margin of error territory. Given the time we had to complete the review, the CPU tests weren't as broad as we would have liked, but we still saw more than a 5% difference at 4K in some of our tests. I know we'd get more varied results with a few other CPU's thrown into the mix with different clocks and core counts as I've seen that before. These differences are certainly much larger at more CPU limited resolutions, but they still exist across the spectrum. 



Your GPU matters more, but saying that you are almost entirely GPU limited at 4K simply isn't an accurate statement. There are enough cases where we can demonstrate a larger difference to show this. The GPU being the bigger factor doesn't equate to the CPU being largely unimportant. However, if you only look at averages, they are broadly the same for most CPU's. Back when the Ryzen 3000 series launched, I tested the 3900X against a Threadripper 2920X which had the same core/thread count. The averages often said they were the same, but the minimum and maximum FPS were very different across the board. Unfortunately, we didn't do 4K testing back then as I didn't have a 4K monitor on the test bench. We were also limited on time as CPU launches tend to give us almost no time to work. 



The point being, I've done enough testing to know that the GPU is still the best place to put the bulk of your budget in a gaming PC build, but a higher end CPU is certainly worth it for 4K gaming if you can afford it."

As a preface: My ambient temperature right now sucks. It's summer, it's hot, my office doesn't have AC. My ambient temp is probably at least 30'c.



So, I reinstalled my massive cooler, I adjusted it, made sure that it was making contact, did a few tweaks to try and force contact. I took the cpu out and made sure the damn things actually connected, i've done everything aside from straight up lapping it.



I'm still getting around 50c idle.  Now, from the research i've been doing.  My ""idle"" isn't truly idle.  I have constant monitoring services open.  I have afterburner for my GPU, and I use rainmeter for monitoring things like temperatures, individual core usage, fan speeds, and most importantly, I have a monitoring service for my 9 hard drives.



Temps went down after i adjusted how the heatsink was installed, load temps went down MASSIVELY.  (I'm talking 95c throttling is now about 80'c during a prime-95 stress test.  Still way too high but... better, shows my heatsink is actually working.)



I booted up HWinfo64 to check my clocks and saw that new Power Reporting Deviation metric that's been making all the rounds lately.  I've read a few articles on it.  I'm seeing that 95% to is considered good.  Which means that things are really bad in my case. 



Mines reporting around 60%. Which means in theory that my cpu is constantly pulling around 2V and my idle is at 1.5v and no wonder i'm getting boosts to 4.6ghz constantly even at low load and everything is running so hot.  If I had 2v and no thermal ceiling i'd probably be pushing 4.6ghz too!



So I said fuck it. I went to my UEFI, turned my SOC down to 1.00, turned my offset voltage to the lowest it could go, -.1 and went to see if it booted.  Most of what i've read said that this is basically a situation that would never boot.  Mine did.



It booted fine, it stress tested fine, hell, my cinebench numbers are practically identical.  This makes me think that that Power Reporting Deviation is actually true.  I've been juicing my CPU a full near 50% higher volts than required.

I've only had it running this way for a few hours now but I don't see any reason that I need to change it unless it becomes unstable.



So, i'm assuming this is likely a motherboard issue? This won't be fixed from a BIOS update because I'm frankly amazed this low tier, launch, discontinued, x370 board got as many bios updates as it has.



So, with some more messing around and doings things manually -



I turned on voltage at a constant 1.1  and boost clock to 3.8, my idle went down to 42c, my load temp was about 65c.  I'm gonna mess around with this some more, but is there a way to set a max boost clock that doesn't become a constant all core clock?  Or is that something that I'd need to use Ryzen Master to tweak?



Note: Important to note that despite the temps, this has all been perfectly stable.  I haven't crashed te cpu once YET from any of the changes i've done.

1200af should have been launched at $65.



3300x being what it is blasted in all the launch PR should stay where it is.



The 1600af I get why they raised the price, but seeing as how it debuted at $85 should have stayed there.



Enthusiasts are going to eat up the 3300x bc that gamjng use case that drove 1600/2600/1600af/3600 sales is a no brainier driver for another I socket cpu sale.

tbh i have two theories with the 1600AF, either they thought it wasn't going to sell worth a damn so they just put it at a price and hoped to clear out all the stock they had OR they intended for it to be a limited run cpu and when they ran out that was going to be it. instead it actually sold well so they've continued to produce them which probably isn't cheap.



the 3300x though looks like a fun cpu, i may just grab one for shits and giggles to mess with it. curious to see if the 3300x is being used as a test platform for a new CCX design in later zen based cpu's. similar to how they released the HD4770 back in the day on 40nm to test the process before releasing the HD5000 series on 40nm 5 months later.



logistics are still completely screwed up right now so i'd say we have at least another month or two before things start to show signs of getting back to normal. even at my work we were all assuming with everything starting to open again the amount of volume we were moving was going to start dropping, but the complete opposite has happened and now it's starting to go back up again. we're still 230% over what we'd normally be doing this time of year.

			I got rid of a 5GHz 6700k system for 3900x system and could not be happier with the results for gaming. I play Battlefield 4, 1 & 5 all were CPU limited with 1080Ti & 2080Ti, so it depends on the games you play. My avg FPS went up 20-30 FPS with 2080Ti which I consider substantial and well worth the upgrade. For productivity it's a no brainer.

I find these posts from actual users very informative, thanks for sharing actual experience.



To OP: some slightly higher clocked ryzens should be coming out soon hopefully, like the 3800xt/3900xt which might be a great fit for your usage. (Depending on price and availability though).  Slightly higher clocks will help close up the s difference in games (Intel will still be faster in some though).  Kind of a crap shoot what will be in stock first though.  If gaming is your first priority, might want to just wait on 10600k/10700k availability, who knows when prices will stabilize for anything at this point."

Supposedly these chips will hit clock speeds up to 4.8ghz and 4.7ghz.  If this is true, AMD is about to rain all over Intel's Comet Lake parade.

AMD is said to have optimized the turbo boost algorithms and binning better quality chips for these XT models.



Higher performance by 5-10%?  Yes Please.  AMD looking to curb stomp Intel with their Matisse refresh before Ryzen 3 4000 chips finally arrive in 2021.

Is anybody else excited about this?  The new XT chips will definitely give consumers more options if they are building a brand new computer over the summer!"

			Been running benchmarks and stress gaming for s few hours now.  Hit XMP, put the RAM at the previously stable 2800 and everything booted and ram perfectly.  Even did a prime 95 torture test - CPU is surprisingly staying around 60c, with prime 95 running the VRMs got a toasty 90c, but I haven't seen them go above 65c in literally any other scenario and it's usually staying around 50c.  In general temps are lower than my 1700, but considering I had to keep my 1700 at a constant 3.9ghz to be stable that kinda makes sense.



Biggest change thus far is I'm now mostly GPU limited in Planet Coaster, at 4k instead of a fluctuating 20fps I'm sitting around 40-45, I'm sure I can mess with more settings to get that higher.  Cities Skylines is still only about 25FPS, but it's a FAR more responsive 25fps, which is nice, but a little underwhelming.



Monster Hunter World is now basically a locked 60fps, even in super intense screen situations.  I honestly didn't think that I was CPU limited there, so a damn nice improvement.



I'll give Doom Eternal and some FPS a try later tonight, I know I was CPU limited at high refresh rates on a few.



The bad news is that putting my RAM over 3000 is an instant crash and bootloop till the motherboard hard resets itself.  Putting it at 2933 loads into windows but crashes under load.  Might be stuck at 2800.  So I'm guessing that's a motherboard limitation.  So be it.



Beat my previous best 3dmark score by nearly 1000 and finally broke 10k!



Alright.  More gaming to do, everything thus far has been with my side off, but I'll put the sides back on when I upgrade my cooler this weekend.   So far I'm happy.

90c is hot but not overly so for a VRM. What ram do you have and what die it is (check with Typhoon Burner)? There are some dies that simply do not clock and your only hope is to tighten the timings as much as you can."

That XT ensures that you are getting the highest binning. And on top of that AMD revised the boost algorithms so the XT are faster in every way. That said, the XT chips are cool but they are not for those who already have non-XT chips.



And to be fair I don't get the hate on XT chips. AMD released them at the same MSRP. And ppl want to throw crap at AMD for releasing an improved revised chip at the same price? That the non-XT chip street prices have come down ""in time"" doesn't mean the XT chips are a ploy to rip off consumers, my gawd. Hell, MC has already dropped prices on the XT chips quite a bit."

I have what might be considered an odd situation by some definitions, in that I recently have come to find myself keeping an old Turion/Phenom system alive for the long-haul for several compelling reasons.  This necessitates the gathering of NOS parts; and a processor is on the menu for this course.  After well over 30K hours and a new motherboard, it's getting to be time ;o)



To that end, I have noticed what looks to be a somewhat disturbing trend in places like eBay, Amazon, and independent online outlets which sell NOS.  It seems as though used processors from the Chinese recycling market(?) are flooding many of these corners & being sold as ""new"" or ""open box"".  Having received several of these specimens from a wide variety of sources, I can safely say that I have yet to receive anything which could be considered ""new"" by most objective standards; and have been ripped off irrespective of seller reputation or item price point.  I'm getting to feel a bit like Diogenes as his lamp ran low on oil...



After some time of all this, I'm now thinking of heading over to the NOS world which supplies MIL/AERO; but haven't quite gotten there yet.  Getting an actually ""new"" processor item in original, sealed vendor packaging(!), or something which has been handled in accord with anything resembling standard industry ANSI/ESD-S20.20-2014 practices, would be of significant comfort in light of what seems to be commonly out there these days.



Anyone have thoughts, favorite sources for these items, or similar experiences to share?

It was literally the only motherboard I could find in stock at the time I bought it, and it's been holding up decently well.  RAM speed has been an issue.  Constantly.  I've never been able to run RAM over 3000 and be stable.



I've had the upgrade itch lately, mostly because there are a lot of games that I can't play at high refresh rates (such as Doom Eternal) or i'm straight up CPU throttled (Planet Coaster, Planet Zoo, etc.)



I did my research and the Gaming K4 X370 is 8+4 phase VRM. It does have a beta bios that has support for 3900X and 3950X. My power supply should be able to handle it, and I can get the cooling required - but what are the chances that this is somehow gonna go sideways? I'm not really interested in overclocking once I get the 3900X in there, I've been running my 1700 at 3.9ghz for 3 years now and I'm sure that the 3900X is gonna be a noticeable increase even at stock.



Am I worrying too damn much?



I'm not looking to upgrade my motherboard at this time, i'm literally just wanting to get the best processor I can into this system right now.  I'll likely get an X570 or B550 motherboard to get a Ryzen 4000 series CPU in the future, however I want this system to be the best it can be before I give it to my SO. 



Also, on the BIOS page it warns to not update the BIOS unless you're gonna upgrade your CPU. I'm still using P 5.1 because of those warnings, but I'd assume that I just slowly upgrade each bios until I hit 5.8 BEFORE I attempt to install the 3900X (3950X) when I get one?

			There isn't a definitive guide. But there is an order and process to it. These cpus are very different from previous generations of cpus from AMD and Intel. They react to context changes incredibly fast so if you by default are monitoring the wrong sensors it will ""look"" hotter or worse than it really is. Thus first I'd recommend learning to monitor the cpu the right way. Yea, there's actually a right and wrong way. Read link below for a quick primer on setting up monitoring. Tip, core voltage is SVI2 TFN, cpu temp is cpu die average, clocks are effective clock...



https://hardforum.com/threads/build...2-raid-render-monster.1990145/post-1044457505



Now for your other question getting the best out of the chip. The truth is leaving it stock is best for most users. W/o overclocking the next step is to tweak your memory and max out the infinity fabric clock. We do this by overclocking the memory from say 3600mhz to 3800mhz which is typically the max speed for the fabric, taking it from 1800mhz to 1900mhz. Download dram calculator, use the safe profile for starters and start inputting the timings into your bios. This improves the latency all around and will net a couple % in benchmarks.



https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/ryzen-dram-calculator-by-1usmus.246327/



The next steps are different methods of overclocking, but before that one needs to find the maximum safe voltage. And that begins a whole other ball of wax. The post below is a good cliffnote on voltage and the silicon FITness monitoring. Basically each chip is different so you have to run a specific test to find your own specific chips safe voltage.







https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ejgc6p/1325v_is_not_safe_for_zen_2/







Going to CCX overclocking is great but OP needs to go over the basics first like finding his max safe fit voltage or monitoring the cpu, etc etc.

Sir I want to follow along, but are you saying that Ryzen is perfect out of the box and it is just monitoring software giving bad temp readings? It has been proven that motherboard manufacturers are juicing the voltages, or at least the readings reported to the chip. I understand that Ryzen shows high voltage at idle then decreases under load. I am not panicking over that. So I need to follow that last link first? Edit: looks like you deleted that part. This is confusing, that reddit post says stock voltage is unsafe. This is what I am talking about. I am not trying to be combative, but you claim that only one monitoring service is right, then to tweak memory then a reddit post that says I need to lower voltage. I really do appreciate the responses, I am sorry if I am not getting some obvious thing.

			Vendors are also better at bios updates, boards are built better and last longer, etc.  I've been bitten by WAY too many cheap boards over the years; I keep systems till they die 90% of the time - they just move on from being a primary to my wife, on to a server, NAS, etc.  Last time I went budget on a board was one of the ones that hit the list here as ""worst motherboards of all time"", and my fancy X370 board has only a really shitty cheap BIOS update for Zen2 because MSI doesn't care when you bought a $150-200 board.



Vice versa, every time I've bought a high end board, it's lasted at least 10 years and done everything I could have ever asked of it, even if some of the stuff wasn't used for the second half of its life.  My Core2 system just finally gave up the ghost about a year ago.  Was doing duty as a small NAS in the end.



That's one place (the other is the AIB GPU I buy) I'm very particular.  I just want shit to ~work~, and high end boards tend to just ~work~.

That doesn't have anything to do with real world MBs today. $200 motherboards will run a 3900x the same as a $300 board, the exact same as a ripoff $700 CH8. Hell the $280 Strix-E has the same vrms, same ROG bios for less than half the cost. You need to get real man, you are suggesting an EPEEN setup. Do whatever you want, its your money. But don't come on suggesting you have to overpay for the same thing just because of poor rationalizing. The x370 boards are known to be missing future support because they are damn old. C'mon man..."

Problem is glaringly obvious, the cooler. Low profile cheap aluminum only blow down coolers are junk, you're not going to ever get good temps with them. I'll give AMD credit for using a slightly better fan than Intel, but the light and cheap extruded aluminum is still the limiting factor.



Quite literally any cooler with heatpipes will be better than that cooler, whether it be blowdown or tower. My go to cooler is a Hyper 212 plus or evo, but other coolers like the Deep Cool GAMMAXX 400, Zalman CNPS5X and Cooler Master Hyper TX3 are fine too."

I will answer this, although you didn't ask for my opinion. You don't need 12 cores... And even with the new consoles that comes with 8 core Ryzens, i don't think the 8 cores will be fully exploited, exactly because there is also the PC market that devs have to consider and companies are still selling new quads and they can't cut all these potential customers off. They will have to include them at least in the minimum requirements. The 3300X, in Battlefield, which i think can load 8 cores just fine, beats the 2600 which is 6 core.  By the time games really start to benefit from 12 cores, you will have upgraded your CPU 4 times."

To illustrate the point, I have effectively tripled the airflow through my case recently with modifications, but only dropped a few (2-3) degrees off the peak load temperatures. 

Likewise if you remove one of the fans from a D15 cooler, you net a loss of 1.5-2C at best, despite the added flow. 



Further, increasing fan speeds to “maximum warp” does not make much of a difference from 70-75% but increases noise substantially."

			That's not how that works...

The x5660s would have to be 100% faster (twice as fast) to do it in 54min... 54mins is roughly half of 1hr49min.



If the x5660s were running 50% faster (4.2GHz) they would get it done 50% faster not 100% faster.

x5660 @ 2.8GHz=107min or 1hr49min

x5660 @ 4.2GHz=71min or 1hr11min



your math = 107 * 0.50 = 53.5min

correct math = 107 / 1.50 = 71min     (4.2GHz is 150% of 2.8GHz  or 1.50x of 2.8GHz or 50% faster than 2.8GHz)



That makes it even more impressive!

the 3900x has about a 50% IPC lead on the x5660

			Really appreciate the feedback everyone, it felt like a dumb series of oft repeated questions/hypotheticals  but I'm glad I put it out there to see what others thought.  Makes me glad to see these forums alive and well still after being away so long.



But after even MORE debating (some parts being out of stock or just not even out yet helps prevent impulse buys lol), I decided to stretch the legs on my X58 just a little bit longer until the release of Zen 3 / X670 mobos along with RDNA/Big Navi/Ampere releases.



It's actually been kinda fun dusting off my overclocking notes and giving the old rig some long overdue maintenance.  I noticed the temps were above normal on the CPU/GPU so I replaced their very old TIM which made an appreciable difference.  The downside is that my i7 930 is tired and showing obvious signs of degradation (temps are up 10c from their old baseline and it does NOT like the voltages I used to run her at), I had to drop my OC to 3.8 and find the lowest vcore I could for stability.



Then did some research on how else I could maximize what I have for as little money as possible.  So I went with a Xeon X5670 I got off ebay for about 30 bucks.  Hoping I get a good one and am able to hit 4.4 - 4.6ghz.  Got another 6 gigs of ram for about 40 bucks to fill out the slots and I'll be running 12gb (lol) total soon enough.



Will this run future AAA titles at max settings and 100+ fps? No.  Will it run the games of the last 5+ years at 1080p high/max settings at around 60fps give or take? It will and I'm ok with that.  That said, I am very excited to see what Zen 3 and the upcoming GPU launches will bring to the table.  Going further, I briefly thought about waiting for AM5/Ryzen 5000 but that seems like an eternity from now and my life can and probably will change drastically between now and then.



Im hoping my next WOW! moment in gaming/PC hardware will be jumping into 4k resolution max settings at a solid 60+ fps or perhaps even better high refresh 4k gaming? (my last one was playing an FPS across a triple monitor setup on a 480GTX SLI)   Maybe then I'll be in a position to put something really special (custom hard tube watercooling, monster 4k screen) together that can hopefully carry me another 10 years lol.

Honestly not a bad route. I always see everyone reccomending some high end hardware for the most basic tasks anymore.



I think it all comes down to each users specific use case. I'm currently sitting on my ""budget"" Ryzen.








	
	
		
		
			R5 1600 - $50 (couldn't pass it up)

Asrock X370 - $65 (I think it was)

16GBs of 2666 CL13 (good price when I bought it)

RX480 (bought at launch) (so.. what? 4 years strong now?)

Does EVERYTHING I need and plays pretty much any of my games anything at 75fps solid (freesync monitor).



Only thing i'm really looking at is an SSD upgrade (to a 1TB nvme) and maybe a 3700x and some 3000+ MHz RAM. Really good chance I'll run this hardware for a good long while. Especially given the ""speed wall"" hardware has hit in the last 5-7 years.

			I don't play many FPS so most of my games aren't going for massive framerates.  However, very noticeable increases:

Note: These are mostly at 4k with my 1080ti.



Pretty much any Ubisoft game, especially with Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, Hitman 2 - there was a weird stutter that existed on the 1700 that's absolutely eliminated now. Much, much smoother and average framerates did go up along with massive improvements in minimum framerates.



Monster Hunter World: Definitely didn't expect that I was CPU limited here, but my previously slightly inconsistent 60fps is now almost perfectly consistent. It's hard to apply numbers too, but overall just FAR better.



In one of the few games I do care about FPS, I can finally go over 110FPS in Doom Eternal is now around 150fps. at 1440p. HUGE increase there.



The biggest improvement for me overall are Frontier's games, Planet Zoo, Planet Coaster, Jurassic World Evolution, etc. My framerate went from 25ish in big parks to 40-50. More than double. I play these games a LOT and this is more than worth it for me.



Cities Skylines, frustratingly, is still around 25 FPS in my biggest cities. It's a more responsive 25fps but still just a sad 25fps.



If you have a title that you'd like me to test in particular, let me know.  I own the obvious free to play stuff like Fortnite and Apex Legends, PUBG, etc. but I don't play them that often.  I am curious if PUBG runs any better, maybe i'll reinstall that one...

Yes a big increase. But 110 fps isn't limiting at all, or is it? and it is @ a meager 1440p. I thought you gamed at 4K?"

			but you are testing 9900k,10900k, and 3900X those are all top of the line procs!   you can't say procs dont' make a difference what about 4930k or 2600k or a FX-6300 in the mix if the processor doesn't matter.  Plus you are most likely testing games that were coded to run on an Xbox or PS4 where the game engine is designed to run on jaguar cores anyway.   then you're saying well the biggest difference was minimum frames.  yeah  because the games prob felt like they were stuttering and frametimes were all over the place especially when lots of stuff was going on at the same time.  Wait till some of the next gen games drop and start telling me your little puny intel quad is gonna keep up with the big boys.   Really kinda just upsets me to see people recommending that others to get bottom end, minimum spec processors for gaming rigs which in turn will turn people off of PC gaming in the future becuase their rigs run like shit when new games come out.   I mean yeah if all you want to do is play counterstrike: source.  then yeah  go ahead and build you an I7 920 rig and be happy.   but look think about you're posting at?..  ..this is [H]ard OCP son!   GO [H]ard or GO {h}ome.  we ain't about a bunch of panzy @$$ pentiums round here!   and think about it, if you build a system with a solid enough backbone, you can always keep it going a few years and just upgrade the GPU instead of having to build a whole new rig.  so keep that in mind too.



p.s.  funny the guy w/ the 10900k is telling everyone else to get a weaker proc.  thats some sewer tactics, bro.

In games that make better use of many logical cores, they're pretty closely matched (ex: Assassin's Creed Odyssey/Origins), particularly at 4K resolution.



I think I'd do my very best to avoid buying anything new right now, and wait for Ryzen 4000, which is supposed to actually be faster.

Lol I do think Ryzen has a very real chance to be extremely competitive, by that I mean better in some areas and worse in others but there’s a large gap between Athlon 64 and Ryzen where the AMD fans were led to believe they were going to regain the performance crown and it never happened.

That refers to power usage not temps or voltages. It's a good test to run... but a different topic.



However there is a distinction to be learned here. By default most software by that I mean 99% software monitoring is doing it wrong when it comes to Ryzen 2 cpus. Hell even motherboards heh. Take the voltage for example, Ryzen two has different situations for voltage, low current and high current loads and in the case of dual CCD chips, where that voltage is actually going, CCD 0 or CCD1 or both CCD. The problem is there is only one voltage reading and it does not distinguish between the different situations. Thus its important to know how the voltage works so we don't automatically freak out. Lemme explain the two main current loads. Low current load is single core usage and in this situation voltage can spike up to 1.5v and it is safe SINCE it is a low current load, ie. only one core. High current laods are when all cores are maxed out or near max and this voltage will not exceed the max fit voltage for high current loads. It is usually in the ballpark of 1.325v and most often less. What this means is that you will generally speaking never see 1.4v while all cores are at max or near max load. And when you do see close to 1.5v it is only going to one core.

I used the stock cooler with my 2600x for a while and while it cooled adequately it definitely could have used improvement. I replaced it with a Hyper 212 EVO when I caught it on sale for $25 and it was a great deal. Idle and load temps dropped considerably.



I rarely ever go above 65C with all 12 threads loaded down now and my ambient is only 1C or 2C below yours most of the time. I'm talking about full load on all threads. This is normally when running a distributed computing project or video encoding. It's also extremely rare that I drop below 4Ghz all core boost. That all said, I am running a push/pull configuration with the Hyper 212 Evo as I had a spare 120mm fan sitting around and that did drop temps by a few degrees over the single stock fan.



As far as software tweaks and settings go, you've done just about everything I know to do in order to get temps under control. The stock Wraith Stealth heatsink is the primary cause for the higher temps and that won't change until you change that heatsink."

They are well over that, watch around 9mins. From what Wendell showed, the XT's are definitely faster in every aspect at least by 5%. But the real attraction is the the overclocking ability especially for ratio overclocking. That said if counting pennies is the priority then ofc the XT isn't worth it. Still, for me at least the cost difference is hardly anything when Microcenter is giving 50 bucks off a board on the XT chips, where the old chips only get 20 off.

That is correct in a way but never ever have I seen AMD being able to capitalize on it so well (that is if the 15% holds water). There is a slide with the exact numbers for the improvement of the 7nm (vs 14nm) process I think it was 1.35 (performance)

AMD CPUs just offered me more for a better price, are soldered, come with a useable stock cooler, the idea to switch to the latest AM4 CPU in 2020 if needed, actually dropping prices when a new generation comes out, and and and... Intel offered me better fps, but do I really care if I'm never getting the highest end GPU and not playing @1080? I'm always GPU bottlenecked, so are a lot other people, explaining that and showing them what the difference is if you run Intel vs Ryzen in a not ""everything high end but playing on a 1080p""-build, converted a lot of decisions to take AMD over Intel. Pretty much always advicing to put more money on your display and GPU these days. You will be shocked positively how much you improve your gaming enjoyment if you save money from buying just a 2600/x and taking the saved money to buy 1440p 144hz/better Graphics card over taking a extremely pricey Intel Core CPU and staying at 1080p/lower the Graphics card budget.

Then your cpu never sustains 5 ghz all core with avx because you have c states, speedshift enabled and even turbo boost limit not maxed out. Download hwinfo64 and run an encoder that uses the cpu (eg davinci resolve) for an mp4 and show your cpu core speeds and temps. I also want to see Apex on all cores with temps shown. On mine with 1.38v it averages 68C but there are spikes when the game loads where the cpu hits 82C.  If I encode a large mp4 in davinci resolve using the cpu it can hit 90C with a big file and all cores pegged at 5 GHz.

V-Sync could be what's responsible for the massive frame rate drops as well. If your at 60FPS due to V-Sync, and for some reason the frame rate falls below that, it gets halved. That would absolutely explain this issue."

			Then your cpu never sustains 5 ghz all core with avx because you have c states, speedshift enabled and even turbo boost limit not maxed out. Download hwinfo64 and run an encoder that uses the cpu (eg davinci resolve) for an mp4 and show your cpu core speeds and temps. I also want to see Apex on all cores with temps shown. On mine with 1.38v it averages 68C but there are spikes when the game loads where the cpu hits 82C.  If I encode a large mp4 in davinci resolve using the cpu it can hit 90C with a big file and all cores pegged at 5 GHz.

			Well, I mean, I think AMD actually raised prices back to the release prices of Zen2.  I'm pretty sure the current pricing was in the form of official price cuts.  I doubt the ""official"" price of the 3900x is still $499.  I'm pretty sure I read that it was $420 now.



Once again, whether or not it is worth it is subjective.  I probably would just save the money with the non-XT chip.

No, Zen 2 kept -pace with Zen 1 pricing (1700 was the exact same price as the 3700X launched at)



And the $500 option (3900X) jumped you up to 12 cores, instead of a highly-overclocked 1800x.



I'd call that a high-end price-cut, and of course the prices have fallen  by around $100 froom launch."

6700K is slow compared to a stock 3900x and that's just in single core with a 6700K at 4.6ghz. At 4.6ghz a 6700k nets around 475 in R20 single and a 3900x nets around 505 in R20 single. In multi... not even worth mentioning. I gave my old 6700K at 4.8ghz to my daughter."

			So, in the past, I have never cared about overclocking or seriously tweaking in the bios. My first build was with an Athlon xp and a 9800pro, that will tell you how long I have been a builder(for myself and the occasional family member.) Back then tweaking was more serious and, quite honestly, it was tough to risk parts you could not replace. Over the past 15 years or so I have simply bought the best intel chip, the best nvidia card, enabled xmp and called it a day. So here I am today all in on 2 Ryzen builds because, well we get older and, hopefully, have more funds for this hobby, AMD finally gets it shit together and makes a compelling product that is interesting enough for me to finally switch back. Interesting, as I made these recent purchases I kept saying that to myself. AMD is more interesting right now, they are trying some things that are not brute force and competing. Now I am sitting here with my 3700x and my 5700xt and I have done the same thing I always do, xmp enabled, all else to auto, job done.



It doesn't feel quite right. This is a fully custom water loop system, and my temps are not where they should be. Don't misunderstand, the temps are ok, idle mid 30's and 79 under AIDA64 stress test. However I do know water cooling, I have done it alot. That is good but not quite what it should be. I have tested and tried everything on the hardware side, trust me on this, I have gone overkill on cooling hardware. Please do not misunderstand, I am not afraid for my cpu or system, it runs fine, but I have read so much about voltage, PBO, setting everything up right with ryzen master, power plans, etc etc. I do believe that as a Ryzen owner there are some tweaks that I need to make to get the temps that I should have and to get the most out of it.



So that is what I am asking, is there a definitive guide to how to optimize ryzen processors? Can one of you guide me through the process? Yes there are lots of opinions on the internet, but I trust these forums rather than some guy with a blog or, god forbid reddit.



I am using an Asrock x570 Taichi, 3700x, gskill trident z neo 3600. Bios is up to date as is chipset.  I humbly ask for your knowledge.
		
		Click to expand...
	
All I can tell you is PBO essentially makes manual overclocking almost pointless. However, if you can figure out per CCX overclocking, then it may be worth it. I have a 3600 and 2 x 3700X's and manually overclocking them really makes no noticeable difference."

			Maybe I'm remembering it wrong, but I believe the first threadrippers were amazingly priced and each subsequent release was more and more expensive. As they passed Intel, their prices increased.



Any company worth their salt is going to sell their product at the maximum they think a user will pay. AMD is no different. When Intel was on top, they charged more than AMD, and now we are seeing something similar with Intel making massive drops on their CPU's becuase they aren't the top guy anymore.
		
		Click to expand...
	
relatively yeah they were priced to compete but each generation has been priced to compete even though they likely could of charged more.



1950x 1000 dollars -> 2950x 899 dollars -> 3950x 750 dollars and on a cheaper socket

2970WX 1299 dollars -> 3960x 1399 dollars without all the issues the 2970WX had

2990WX 1799 dollars -> 3970x 1999 dollars without all the issues the 2990WX had

1700x ->399 dollars > 2700x 329 dollars -> 3700x 329 dollars

1600x 249 dollars -> 2600x 229 dollars - > 3600x 249 dollars





so the only things that went up in price were the 3960x and 3970x and for good reason..



now should they increase prices? probably, especially if intel keeps over charging for their garbage but it really comes down to whether or not they feel zen 3 will get them the market share they want while being at a higher price. i'm going to assume their profit margins must be pretty good if they were willing to drop prices as quickly as they were for zen 2."

			7700k looks WAY faster in gaming; especially when overclocked. In most gaming benchmarks it's anywhere from 3600x level to above the 3950x. Matches my experience from side-grading from a 7700k @ 4.9 to the 3700x.

You do realize you linked a video to the slower 3100 to make a point about the 3300x right?  I'm looking at upgrading my son's 6600k with the 3300x, should be a pretty good upgrade.  Has enough cores for most games and decent boost clocks on zen 2.  Most benches I've found have the 3300x out in front of the 7700k in most things, which is pretty impressive for a $120 chip.  So my choices for his platform are find a used 7700k for $200+... Or buy the 3300x for $120 + $80 MB... For $200 brand new and have more performance.  If i were to go Intel, what can you get for that price that can keep up with/outpace a 7700k?"

			Go 3900x.  It is significantly faster than your 1700 in games due to higher clock speed, larger L3 cache, and in content creation, due to extra cores and threads.

I dropped one into my X370 mainboard that has previously run a 1700 and 2700 and not sad I did it.



It has better price/perf than the 3950x while offering better game performance.  If your workload leans more toward content creation, and you have the mainboard and cooling to support, then go with the 3950X.

This system is more towards content creation, less towards gaming (gaming is a ""I need a break - fuck it, UT/Subnautica on a 30 minute timer so I get back to work"").

Why do you want to spend $379 for the Asus motherboard? Honestly, it isn't needed. You could save some money there and for the CPU if you take the 3900X instead of the 3950X and rather upgrade the GPU to a 2080 Super or 2080ti.

I would've recommended this Mobo https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/MAG-X570-TOMAHAWK-WIFI but it is not yet available.

I just checked newegg.com, geez, all X570 mobos are out of stock. I personally run the Gigabyte Aorus X570 Ultra and it is very good so far. BIOS support is top notch and price was OK, but also this one is not available right now. Even my local Microcenter has only 1 X570 motherboard in stock.



Edit:



Just saw you want to watercool your CPU and motherboard. So disregard my board suggestion.

Wendell has his points but he sounds like he hasn't had a Dev job in a long time.  Many of his points come from a beige pants in seat cube farm type of mindset.

Come over to this thread and tell me what you want me to test... (I mean, here is fine too, I can always cross-post it)

[Unboxing/1st Impressions] HP ENVY x360 w/ AMD FX-9800P



As Pieter mentioned, they didn't properly setup the BIOS to run the RAM at the right speed, so there's a potential bottleneck for gaming or memory-intensive stuff. However, day-to-day stuff has been very snappy and responsive in everything I've been doing. AMD has done a fine job with this chip IMO, it's just HP who kinda dropped the ball in certain regards. Nevertheless, with the current price drop on this laptop of $100 ($579), I am liking this a lot more than I was at $679 (I contacted Sales and was reimbursed).



Just let me know what tests you want me to run and if whatever program it is is small enough (I have limited bandwidth) I'll be more than happy to run it."

My daughter has not said anything about her 1600 AF as it's setting in a MSI B350M Gaming Pro eating 3333Mhz memory clocks at 32Gb Oloy http://www.3dmark.com/fs/21781824   and it was an early $85 chip .. it competed Fire Strike running 3600Mnz speeds but not 100% stable .. http://www.3dmark.com/fs/21479515 so it's range is between those speeds IMO and as you can see it wakes up the faster the memory runs .

I have the same kit but with dual 16GB double sided DIMMs running at 3400 14-15-14-28-1T...I can get the same 3600 pandora's box is getting, but I am not 100% sure it is stable yet.  I am probably 98% of the way there.



It was really hot this weekend and with my loop torn down I was reaching the limits of my what a case with hardly no airflow being able to tolerate.  I didn't want the DIMMs to get toasty since I was already hitting 75C on the CPU during 16 thread handbrake/real bench testing.





I think once I have my loop up and with the 3x120mm top fans blowing down cool outside air on the VRM/DiMM area I will get 3600 stable.   If that fails I will try 3533 straight 14, and failing that 3400 c14 straight."

Hit XMP, put the RAM at the previously stable 2800 and everything booted and ram perfectly.  Even did a prime 95 torture test - CPU is surprisingly staying around 60c, with prime 95 running the VRMs got a toasty 90c, but I haven't seen them go above 65c in literally any other scenario and it's usually staying around 50c.  In general temps are lower than my 1700, but considering I had to keep my 1700 at a constant 3.9ghz to be stable that kinda makes sense.



Biggest change thus far is I'm now mostly GPU limited in Planet Coaster, at 4k instead of a fluctuating 20fps I'm sitting around 40-45, I'm sure I can mess with more settings to get that higher.  Cities Skylines is still only about 25FPS, but it's a FAR more responsive 25fps, which is nice, but a little underwhelming.



Monster Hunter World is now basically a locked 60fps, even in super intense screen situations.  I honestly didn't think that I was CPU limited there, so a damn nice improvement.



I'll give Doom Eternal and some FPS a try later tonight, I know I was CPU limited at high refresh rates on a few.



The bad news is that putting my RAM over 3000 is an instant crash and bootloop till the motherboard hard resets itself.  Putting it at 2933 loads into windows but crashes under load.  Might be stuck at 2800.  So I'm guessing that's a motherboard limitation.  So be it.



Beat my previous best 3dmark score by nearly 1000 and finally broke 10k!



Alright.  More gaming to do, everything thus far has been with my side off, but I'll put the sides back on when I upgrade my cooler this weekend.   So far I'm happy."

This Toshiba with a C2D is getting long in the tooth, but is a trooper. But I digress, all I wanted originally was an Android AMD tablet with 1080p... there has been like 2 as I recall. Both were packing the Z01 which bleh, and one was a Toughbook >$1000 which was absurd. I feel as though the OEMs are still being pressured by Intel to dump AMD into the crap models that really no one cares about, and the fact it's 2016 with shit still shipping with XXXXx720 screens sure doesn't lend much to contradict that thinking.



That being said... I bit on this thing as soon as it was available, because it gave me what I finally wanted (I can run the AndroidX86 should I want Android). Didn't quite expect it'd be a pre-order though. Had hoped it'd be ready to ship right away, but nope... Wasn't ready until Thursday, and... coming direct from China :\ Arrived in Shanghai yesterday, so hopefully it'll make stateside soon.



However, a few things I'm not too pleased with, and are only reinforcing my thoughts on what I mentioned at the start... First is that the AMD model has zero configuration options, no option to pick a 4K screen, which I don't know if I would've but that's not the point, it should've been since the FX9800P has more than enough power to drive 4K desktop environment. But whatever, didn't bother me much in the end. No what bothered me was later on finding out that the reason it comes with a single 8GB DIMM is because THEY ONLY GAVE IT ONE DAMN SLOT!  Why? Don't know, the brand new Intel model with the 4K option comes with 2 DIMM slots. Again, seems a bit fishy if you ask me... I'm sure as well, it'll mean the AMD variant doesn't have the m.2 slot either, like the Intel does. :sigh:



But in the end, it comes with a 1080p screen, touch at that. It's a convertible which is a bonus! 2TB drive, DDR4, and more surprising was the top model Mobile FX. So while the $720 after tax was more than I had hoped to spend for something with virtually no upgrades, I'm not anticipating anyone else offering a comparable device and this thing will hopefully last me half as long as this Toshiba has (2009). 





Update: It has, much to my surprise, gone straight from China and landed in Memphis, TN! o_0 It's on the opposite end of the state (I'm North of Chattanooga), but it's a lot closer than I anticipated it'd be. However that comes with a smmaaaaaaaall caveat...

I don't know if that's 'normal' or not... I try to stay away from FedEx and UPS, and have not received many items from overseas on top of that. Looks like an invoicing cockup on the shipper's side as it doesn't look like they declared a quantity (which may be a bulk shipment and not an individual package?).

HP slated it for a delivery on the 17th, which at this rate seems plausible. Hoping for sooner though, we'll see.

Yeah I agree about the binning.  What voltage are you using for SoC/Vddr?  I am at 1.1V and 1.45V respectively, but that was to ensure stability first.  I haven't had time to try to lower them down due to cooling issues.



I went to reassemble my loop and something told me to check my CPU block.  Opened it up and it was full of crap.  Checked the tubing and it was as well.  I made the mistake of letting the loop sit with some water in it during my back surgery and we had some insane humidity with it regularly getting up to 70%+ indoors.  It's 68f and 71% as I type this with my AC set to 70F.



I had to order a new CPU block since I couldn't get it clean and all new tubing and have to flush my rads.  Never had a single issue with this stuff in the past until moving to the PNW and this darn rainforest.

Good thing the OP switched gears towards a different direction after he thought about his current usage situation. However, had he gone with your suggestion, then he would have substantially blown even that high of a budget because a TR4-socket motherboard by itself costs $600 while the 3960X by itself costs $1,300. That's already $1,900 just for the CPU and motherboard - and that does not include any RAM or GPU at all whatsoever, nor does it come with any SSD storage whatsoever. That leaves only $200 left, total,  for all three components combined. That's just plain pound-foolish, since he will NEVER get anything decent in terms of a GPU, RAM and storage all for $200 combined. In fact, he would have needed to budget another $2,000 just for those components to prevent a major bottleneck in that Threadripper system. Why spend $1,900 on a 3960X with motherboard alone, only to completely choke the entire build with only a GeForce GT 710 DDR3 and only 8 GB total of RAM and only a 128 GB SSD? Makes no sense at all right there."

			tbh i have two theories with the 1600AF, either they thought it wasn't going to sell worth a damn so they just put it at a price and hoped to clear out all the stock they had OR they intended for it to be a limited run cpu and when they ran out that was going to be it. instead it actually sold well so they've continued to produce them which probably isn't cheap.



the 3300x though looks like a fun cpu, i may just grab one for shits and giggles to mess with it. curious to see if the 3300x is being used as a test platform for a new CCX design in later zen based cpu's. similar to how they released the HD4770 back in the day on 40nm to test the process before releasing the HD5000 series on 40nm 5 months later.



logistics are still completely screwed up right now so i'd say we have at least another month or two before things start to show signs of getting back to normal. even at my work we were all assuming with everything starting to open again the amount of volume we were moving was going to start dropping, but the complete opposite has happened and now it's starting to go back up again. we're still 230% over what we'd normally be doing this time of year.

also core vid is closer to your actual voltage, not what the bios reports. i'd mess around with the LLC and see if you can and tighten it up to maybe get 4.4Ghz stable with the 1.3v set if you have the thermal headroom available for at least stability testing it in your configuration.

All of the hardware reviewers went from Straight to the Point to having to meet this ridiculous criteria.

			I switched gears and started a 3300x build after seeing their performance per dollar and taking my current monitor setup into account.  I'm beginning to realize I'm not the hardcore gamer I used to be with the bankroll and desire to back up a high end build anymore and that the hardware scene and what you can do with lower budgets is pretty incredible compared to 10 years ago.   



Once the B550 motherboards (particularly the ASUS ROG Strix B550-E Gaming) come out it looks like I can have a nice 1080p 144hz rig together for just over $1000 which will have me reuse my existing chassis and PSU and throw in a EK waterblock down the line to replace the Wraith cooler.  Then maybe upgrade the CPU in a few years with a Zen 3 CPU if the gains/prices are good.

I know where you 're coming from. That build you made is super fine and very good bang for buck.



I used to do a lot of video encoding and i was always after many cores, but i stopped and now i use the PC for browsing, films and games that are mostly 6-10+ years old. Plus, i want to stay with Win7 for as long as possible... So, i am going for a bang for buck solution too. For now i have: 1 B450 board (the most expensive mobo i 've ever bought), 3 A320 boards (i ordered the 3rd today...MSI A320 VH Pro Plus for EUR70-covid19 effect. I already had one such and also have 1 MSI A320M-A Pro Max. I don't overclock and will be using 65W so who cares about VRM. Besides, the 2 MSI VH have the same VRM as most MSI B350... 2 of them don't have M2, but i don't care about it either.), 2x8GB Corsair 3000C15, 2x8GB Crucial Ballistix 3200C16, 1xRyzen 2600, 1xRyzen 1600AF.



Bottom line: I will be able to have 2 PCs, each with 1 spare motherboard, that will be enough for me for many, many years.

Bonus: I have also an itch for an extra RAM kit (for spares in case a DIMM fries), 1 Ryzen 1200AF (and keep the 1600AF as spare in case the 2600 fries). But i will probably wait for this part...



It's amazing how much value you can get out of budget pieces nowdays. You can get a really powerful machine for cheap."

			I thought you gamed at 4K?
		
		Click to expand...
	
I have two 4k60hz monitor and a 1440p165hz monitor.   In titles where I want over 60fps, I use the monitor that can actually display over 60fps, which is my 1440p one.  In general, i've found that 1440p to be about twice the performance of 4k as long as i'm not cpu bottlenecked.



Doom Eternal was 60fps at 4k with both processors, I don't bother testing over 60fps at 4k because my setup can't display it.   Academic or not, its meaningless to me.



As for 110 fps being limiting - it's not, but the difference between 110 and 150 is pretty damn noticeable on a display that can support it.



I need to reinstall some sort of racing game that's not limited to 60fps to see what those feel like...



I also have a whole lot of games that played at 4k60 that didn't change much. Witcher 3, Star Wars Battlefront, Diablo III, Grim Dawn, all my 2D games perform basically identical (most are limited to 60fps as it is). I haven't touched any of my Far Cry or Tomb Raider titles in a while, I have all the reason to suspect Tomb Raider is gonna run way better now but I honestly don't remember what settings I had it on previously. I'll give Vermintide 2 a go when I find someone to co-op with, and I stopped paying for Xbox Gamepass Live a few months back because the way it installs games was creating issues, so I can't test stuff like Forza Horizon or Gears 5 anymore - but they both ran flawlessly on my 1700 as it was. 



I don't have a VR set so there's a whole lot of VR titles that I have no way to even attempt to test.

I game at 1440P so while Intel may offer slightly better framerates it's not big deal.  But my multithreading performance is so much higher than a 9900K, and even some of Intel's HEDT parts.  I can also get PCIe 4.0 down the road if I upgrade motherboards (however now I'm on X470 so don't have it).  I also like how socket AM4 is sticking around for a bit, Intel never keeps sockets for more than a few years.  It's great that someone who bought X370 at launch can upgrade to any Zen 2 CPU with a BIOS update, and probably can even upgrade to Zen 3 when it comes out.



This is the first time in a long time IMHO that AMD is competitive.  Seems like since Core2Duo Intel has had a pretty big lead and AMD was just a budget choice that couldn't compete.  Can't wait to see the upcoming Intel and AMD CPU performance in the coming years. Given Zen 2 has decent IPC, high core count and good value I hope this pushes Intel to really come out with some good CPUs.  Competition is really good for consumers, would be nice for better price/performance across the board from both Intel and AMD."

The catch is that even if they ""surpass"" Intel, that won't put them in the same position Intel has been in for the last decade or so.  Things are very different now.  They aren't just competing with Intel anymore.  You already have tons of Chromebooks out there using ARM processors.  Soon, Apple will be using ARM processors in all of their desktops and laptops.  Both Intel and AMD are now competing against ARM CPUs from multiple companies.  There is a real possibility that ARM will fully replace x86 within the next decade unless we see some serious innovation from both Intel and AMD."

			sadly, the gaming K4 is just slightly above the ""garbage"" part.. was a good cheap board for the time with the processors it needed to run and that's it. wasn't much thought put into it in supporting later processors.



it's not an 8+4, it's actually a 4+2 configuration with 3 dual drivers and 2 H/L mosfets per driver channel(signal -> driver -> into 2x2 highside/2x2 lowside mosfets). the biggest complaint most people have the board is VRM temps so i wouldn't trust it with a 3950x even stock.. maybe a stock 3900x if you're able to lower stock voltage without loosing any boost performance and have good case airflow over the VRM heatsinks. otherwise i'd say that sub 200 dollar board had a good life and might be time to move up to a higher quality board if you're going to drop 400+ dollars on a cpu. another option since your eventual plan is to move that board on to some one else, i'd actually look at the 3700x. the board should be able to handle that processor just fine and you'll be very close to the same performance in most games to the 3900x.



as far as bios updates go, follow the notes in P5.4 before updating since you're already on P5.1.. 3950 needs P5.5 to run, all the others will work with P5.4 then you can update to P5.8 after the new chips installed.

this has been an AMD socket problem for over a decade. i cant fathom how this was ever allowed to be a final design. let alone fm2 am2 am3 am4.

AMD and their MOBO partners should be embarrassed that potentially 1000$ motherboards supporting up to 750$ CPUs can give a customer such a disastrous outcome for a simple cooler change. or CPU upgrade. or whatever.

there will be untold tens of thousands of customer casualties because of this terrible engineering decision. the consumers and reviewer community outta have a SHIT FIT if AM5 ships with a socket in this style and this poorly designed. EPYC and both Threadripper sockets already have seen the light. does anyone think datacenter customers and workstation users would tolerate such a terrible ""locking lever"" as what has been on the consumer boards for generations. jeez they even did better with most of the opterons socketwise.



if anyone cant tell i feel pretty strongly about this. and its a short coming that hasn't gotten enough attention. not a single person should ever lose or damage a CPU just by removing a cooler from a socket thats supposed to be securely latched.

My first build was with an Athlon xp and a 9800pro, that will tell you how long I have been a builder(for myself and the occasional family member.) Back then tweaking was more serious and, quite honestly, it was tough to risk parts you could not replace. Over the past 15 years or so I have simply bought the best intel chip, the best nvidia card, enabled xmp and called it a day. So here I am today all in on 2 Ryzen builds because, well we get older and, hopefully, have more funds for this hobby, AMD finally gets it shit together and makes a compelling product that is interesting enough for me to finally switch back. Interesting, as I made these recent purchases I kept saying that to myself. AMD is more interesting right now, they are trying some things that are not brute force and competing. Now I am sitting here with my 3700x and my 5700xt and I have done the same thing I always do, xmp enabled, all else to auto, job done.



It doesn't feel quite right. This is a fully custom water loop system, and my temps are not where they should be. Don't misunderstand, the temps are ok, idle mid 30's and 79 under AIDA64 stress test. However I do know water cooling, I have done it alot. That is good but not quite what it should be. I have tested and tried everything on the hardware side, trust me on this, I have gone overkill on cooling hardware. Please do not misunderstand, I am not afraid for my cpu or system, it runs fine, but I have read so much about voltage, PBO, setting everything up right with ryzen master, power plans, etc etc. I do believe that as a Ryzen owner there are some tweaks that I need to make to get the temps that I should have and to get the most out of it.



So that is what I am asking, is there a definitive guide to how to optimize ryzen processors? Can one of you guide me through the process? Yes there are lots of opinions on the internet, but I trust these forums rather than some guy with a blog or, god forbid reddit.

			If the 3900X costs $400 and the XT is $500, does the XT cost 25% more or is the X 20% less?
		
		Click to expand...
	
Both of those statements are accurate.  Which one you use depends on what point you're trying to make .  If you're comparing something to the X which is your baseline, you would normally say XT cost 25% more than the X (your baseline) for (just random #) 5% performance.  But if you wanted to use the math to your advantage, you could say it the other way:  You can save 20% and but you lose 4% performance (notice the same math makes the performance difference seem smaller as well).  So in the end, they are both actually the same.  Now, if you're being disengenious, you could swap the #'s around like... the X is only 20% cheaper than the XT, but the XT is 5% faster than the X.  Notice you are comparing them from different directions/baselines to make both numbers in your favor and still be 100% technically correct.  Or you can do so the other way, you can pay 25% more for the XT but the X is only 4% slower than the XT.  Mixing and matching can make it sound better/worse."

Being a hex-core chip combined with a nice overclock, I thought it was still plenty fast, and I wanted to hold onto that for one more generation at least.  Unfortunately I began to have a very strange issue that would cause the computer to freeze under specific circumstances.  I spent a year or so trying to diagnose the issue, while trying to play around the specific situations where the computer would freeze.  It got to the point where, during the process of my diagnostics, I had swapped out literally every component except for the motherboard and CPU, and even tried stock bios settings / no overclock, etc.  It had to be something with the motherboard or CPU, and I was just tired of dealing with it at that point.  It's probably the first time in my whole life that I didn't upgrade purely for performance reasons.



I had been following the developments with Ryzen for a while, and when I looked at what I would want for a replacement build, X570 + 3900X seemed like a good choice.  I probably don't actually need 12 cores, but I've always preferred to have more cores than I needed.  I ran a dual-xeon rig back in the single-core era, jumped on the quad-core bandwagon back when most gamers still used dual-core, went hex-core when all mainstream chips were still quad-core, and having a 12-core chip now appealed to me in that same regard.  Game performance seems to be about the same as it was with my 5820k @ 4.5Ghz, but at least it's rock-solid stable and I don't have to deal with any BS anymore."

			What are you doing with that thing?  I have 2x L5640's (6/12 each) with 96GB of registered ECC and it barely ever breaks a sweat . Was thinking about setting it up as a software rendering farm for Blender, but honestly I'd be better off buying a few GPU's and offloading. I'm probably going to end up replacing it with a high end zen or low end threadripper, I just think EPYC is overkill for my needs, but always curious what people are able to put together. A single Ryzen 1600 gets about the same multi-core score as my dual xeons. I just bought my son a 3700x for his computer which would walk all over my current server. Every time I think about upgrading it, I remember... it just works and I really don't have a compelling reason. Anyways, just making a post and listening in for some suggestions because you never know .  That link to servethehome has a few lower priced deals.  Finding 'upgrades' isn't a half bad idea, they are the same damn chip, lol, they just call it an upgrade for one of their systems.

I find the biggest motivation to replace older servers is the power consumption.   I was surprised how much my old Bloomfield era Xeons were costing me every month in power.



My server is somewhat of a ""home production"" server.   It runs a bunch of VM and containers for my home use, some of them which are media based, and require real time responsiveness in order to not cause problems, so I have been very careful to not oversubscribe the CPU cores.   No more than one virtual core per physical core has been my philosophy.



I'm less concerned abput having screaming fast cores, just want to make sure that the VM's arent stealing CPU time from eachother should they kick in at the same time.



The server is running Proxmox so that I can easily run both KVM and LXC with a nice web interface.   Things I have running on it:


House NAS via native ZFS on Linux.   The NAS stores all house files (very little is stored on local machines) as well as the house media library (mostly ripped blurays in native disc format)).
Dedicated rsyslogd container for offloading all the firewall logging from my standalone pfSense box (Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS)
Dedicated LXC container for SMB/CIFS shares from NAS (Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS)
Dedicated container for a MythTV backend which I use for PVR/DVR (Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS with LXDE installed, accessed via X2Go)
Dedicated container for a small DHCP server to hand the HD Homerun tuners their IP addresses on a separate subnet (*1) (Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS)
General Purpose Ubuntu server container I use from console for things I want to run offline when I am using my desktop for other things (mainly long downloads, but other stuff as well) (Ubuntu server 16.04 LTS)
Dedicated (and fully Chrooted)  SFTP Server container I use for sharing files with my friends (Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS)
Dedicated container for my Unifi Wireless Access point software. (Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS)
Dedicated container for the server for my Unifi-Video Security Cameras.  (Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS)
Dedicated container for my TeamSpeak server (Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS) 
Dedicated VM for Wireguard VPN server (Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS)
Dedicated VM for a friends remote backups (*2) (UBuntu Server 16.04 LTS)




(*1) The HDHomerun boxes have a nasty habit (which cannot be disabled) of announcing themselves to everything (windows boxes, smart TV's etc) via multicast, and if any user uses these devices to request a tuner, they immediately stop what they are doing and respond.  MythTV expects dedicated tuners and does not play well with others, so I needed to isolate them.   Turns out they lack the ability to set static IP's so I needed a DCHP server on that subnet



(*2) A few years back I was getting frustrated at how expensive colocation was.  I had this extra server and I wanted to stash it somewhere to run remote backups to it via ZFS built in incremental block based Send/Recv command.   Turns out a friend of mine was looking for something similar.   I gave him an encrypted TB of storage on a VM for him to back up to and he let me stash my extra server in his basement.   Nice arrangement.



When I first started doing this, I was using ESXi and everything was a VM.    After I got fed up with VMWare, and migrated to Proxmox and KVM in 2016, I initially ran everything in VM's as well, but then I gradually migrated most of my stuff to LXC containers as they are much more lightweight.   I only kept the VM's where I needed them either for more secure isolation or different operating systems.   Now there are only 2 of them left!



I have to admit, the server does sit with pretty low load most of the time.    This is pretty typical:

This is the last years worth of system averages.  (There was some downtime in May/June due to my move)



Networking data is confusing as it is in Bytes, not in Bits as expected.



ZFS annd VM's love RAM though!

Yeah, I'll be building my own, probably using a Supermicro (or maybe Tyan) board.   I already have a 4U Supermicro CSE 846 which I really like.    I spent some time modding it to put in a custom 3x120mm fan wall (instead of the awful high speed noisy 80mm fans it came with) and ordered their specialty quiet dual 920W power supplies. 



I was completely tuned off from pre-built servers years ago when I bought a HP DL 180 G6 barebones machine on ebay.  The thing was loud even under ideal circumstances.   It had 8x redundant 80mm 18krpm fans.   The fun part was that HP put thermal sensors on all of their supported PCIe cards which dialed home to the HP ILO to tell it everything was A-OK temperature wise.  I needed an HBA for ZFS though, not the hardware RAID card it shipped with, and at the time there werent any, so I installed a 3rd party PCIe SAS HBA.   It didn't have the temp sensor the HP ILO expected, so the system freaked out, assuming it was in an overheated state, and maxed out the 8x 18krpm fans.    The thing literally sounded like a taxiing jumbojet.  



Apparently others agreed, as I have seen it referred to as the HP DL180 G6 Dreamliner.



Listen to this video what it sounds like at post.   Then picture it revving up maybe 25% more than that and staying there if an unsupported PCIe card was inserted....




	
		
	


I had it in my basement, but I could still hear it two stories up in my second floor bedroom, even with all the doors shut in between.  it was crazy.



These HP/Dell/Etc servers are intended for datacenter use, where they are great, but I don't ever want to deal with a noisy server like that again.  I tried modding it (fan volt mods etc.) but could never get it to behave quietly enough to where I could use it at home.   Years later I was able to get a compatible HP SAS HBA, which quieted it down and used it for a little bit as my remote server at my friends house, until I upgraded my main server (In a Norco 4U case) to my current Supermicro SC846 system, and replaced the remote one wit the Norco.



Anyway, since I finally have a case and fan setup I really like, my next upgrade/replacement will simply be a standard form factor server board from SuperMicro or Tyan which will be dropped in this existing case."

			I would buy the X570/3900x combo.  $1700 is a lot of money.  thesmokingman might not have the best tact, but I agree with him in one sense...you don't really need to spend over $300 on an X570 motherboard.  Personally, I tend to buy Asus because I like the fact that they are more proactive with bios updates, sometimes years after release.  I had a CH8 and it was complete overkill for what I was doing.  I downgraded to the Prime-X570 Pro board and it doesn't feel any different (other than saving myself about $150).  I think a good middle ground is that Strix-E board as it is 97% of the CH8 but $299 instead of $379 (or whatever they go for now).



As for TR, if you have to think about whether or not you'd use it to its fullest advantage, you're better off saving money and not buying it, IMO.

			The Wraith Stealth is NOT more than capable of handling the 2600, even the Wraith spire is junk. If by your definition ""capable"" is cooking at near thermal junction under load, then sure it is. Both coolers have the same crappy performance as Intel stock HSFs have had for the past 15 years.




	
		
	


He uses the Ryzen 5 1400, but both that CPU and the 2600 have the same 65W TDP. Under load, the CPU is cooking at a nice 88C with the Stealth (the cooler the OP has) and just a bit less at 84C with the Spire. You may argue that the figures are under thermal junction, but CPUs do not like running that hot and tend to get unstable. It certainly doesn't do the motherboard any favors, nor the capacitors around the CPU socket. The CPU may also be throttling when that hot, but no figures are given for clock speed.



Both the Stealth and the Spire have no business on a CPU that draws more than 45W. The only really decent stock AMD cooler is the Wraith Max or Wraith Prism, which are basically the same cooler, but the latter has RGB.







Idle temps are most certainly important. The higher the idle temperature, the small the margin you have to thermal junction. 50-60C idle is something that should be left in the past with crappy aluminum coolers we used to have to deal with because better options weren't widely available.

I think the main issue with the data points you've provided is that the thermals you reference are an OC from 3.4 GHz stock to 3.8 GHz all-core. So of course in a stress-test scenario with +400 MHz all-core (which in and of itself is silly to do on Ryzen 2000+, especially for the 2600s target audience) you see temperatures a bit below TJ Max. 



Stock coolers are intended for stock settings, and in that regard the Wraith Stealth and its relatives perform more than adequately. The video you posted actually backs up what I am saying.



In addition, and this may be controversial to say, precision boost on Ryzen 2000 and newer kind of defeats the purpose of traditional all-core OCs; of course with the exception being more niche stuff."

Here's a fun question.

So, this is my top exhaust fan. (140mm) I, at the moment, have the cover over the second 140mm hole, but i took it off here.

The red thing that you can see through the hole is my VRM heatsink.

Cause VRM cooling is the issue, if I pushed this exhaust fan to the the other edge of the hole, would it help VRM cooling at all? Or is the difference likely so slight that it won't matter? What if I went really crazy and turned it into an intake fan?  That way it would be blowing cold air directly on the VRM heatsink. (Likely would need a dust filter, but it also works against everything else i've learned in how to direct case airflow...)

I could also install another 140mm fan in the second area, but i don't know if that would actually benefit anything. 



Just thinking outloud mostly.

			4 more cores isn't quite worth the double CPU cost, I'd think? 



3900 - $33 per core

3950x - $41/core, add one VM or so. 

3960x - $59/core, but you're going all the way to 24 cores which would (in my mind at least) double the number of running VMs, vs one more.  Or transcode and game at the same time, etc.  In my mind, of course.   Not sure if that's sane, this is a new market for me, and I'm trying to think it through.



Motherboards are about the same cost right now; since I won't do anything but a higher-end x570 board.  Crosshair VIII Formula or Meg Ace both end at around $600 right now, the MSI creator is $700.  RAM is the same, cooler is the same, case is the same...  only difference is the CPU.
		
		Click to expand...
	
First off, there isn't a 1:1 core relationship between VM's and physical resources. The architecture allows you to over commit resources and still perform adequately. So, a 3950X doesn't just do one VM more than a 3900X because you gave that one VM 4 cores to work with. That's just not how it works. Also, when it comes to performance, it isn't as though you get 4 cores and that's it. The 3950X does boost slightly higher than the 3900X and therefore, does perform a little better in single-threaded applications. 



Also, the 3950X isn't double the price of a 3900X. The 3950X can be had for $699.99 at Microcenter and about $430-$450 on the 3900X if you shop around. Even at $749.99, the 3950X still isn't double the price of the 3900X. It's not super far off, but if you were seriously entertaining buying a Threadripper 3960X, then that really shouldn't make any difference. There is nothing you've described in your use case that suggests you would benefit from the added memory bandwidth, extra PCIe lanes, or additional CPU cores. 



Your costs for the motherboard may be similar, but the CPU is twice as much as a 3950X. RAM isn't exactly the same either. You need four memory modules instead of two. That's not huge by itself, but it adds up. The power requirements and heat dissipation needs of a 3960X are also greater. These should be factored in as well. AIO's on Threadripper are basically varying levels of shit and an air cooler on them isn't really ideal either."

1.19v is basically a golden sample CPU if it can hold that at constant workload with AVX on. So your sample doesn't represent the average 9900K. Nor does it counter my claim that the IHS is pure trash. If they had Ryzen 3000 series back when I built this I'd have jumped on it but right now I can't wait to ditch this garbage and go Ryzen w/the upcoming release. As far as I'm concerned, there's zero use case for Intel CPUs anymore since AMD has them easily beat."

			Good God! I only recently bought a 1600AF and i thought it was the best bargain ever! And now this comes! So much for the ""more cores are better""...  To be completely honest, if i bought the 3300X, i don't know if i should keep the 2600 as main CPU... Because this 3300X seems to be doing everything better except for decompression and other niche stuff...



Unbelievable offerings... I wish AMD had made this public earlier...

Honestly, I would still have got the 1600af if the 3300x was available at purchase.  In gaming, you will really only see a difference running $500+ gpus at 1080p.



Performance for that $ range (gaming), (productivity)

1600af - 7/10 : 10/10

3300x - 9/10 : 8/10



The extra $40 on a gpu will go much further on midrange builds.  It certainly looks like the 1600af is gone for good now though."

Depending on your budget a B550/x570 board and a 3600 can push a $600+ gpu. It also opens up an upgrade path for a faster Ryzen 4000 cpu whenever you feel held back by the 3600.  Am4 will support your next GPU and cpu after this one as well. 



OR. Go all in on the fastest Intel cpu you can afford on a good board and run it into the ground. A decent choice for people who don’t want to mess with upgrades and want it all up front. Obviously this would support another GPU upgrade down the road too.

dude we're so close to Ryzen 4000 i'd wait and see what they'll have to offer.  Plus at that point if you want to still go 3000 you'll be able to get a used one off ebay for half price.   Plus if you're just gaming you really don't need 16 core/32 thread you'll get better performance disabling some of the cores.  so...  if you want a little boost now just grab the gpu you can always use that in your new rig.   but nvidia coming out w/ new stuff too.   basically if you can wait i would even if you grab the same partlist it'll be cheaper when the new stuff comes out. (oh and RTX 2xxx doesn't perform to well w/ rtx on RT suppose to be getting MASSIVE boost in 3xxx)



oh yeah and i'm with @bl4d3runn3r  i'd look at MSI for this round I personally like the  MSI X570 Unify wish i would have got that instead of ASUS TUF.  Just don't buy MSI's low end X570.  Check ""Hardware Unboxed"" youtube channel for more info on all the X570 VRM''s"

			Well that's true. Going from a 4690 to a 3300x is not a $120 upgrade. If your friend sold his 4690 / mobo / ram and purchased a B450 based mobo and 16GB of DDR4-3200 value ram the total upgrade cost could easily be less than $200, though. It would cost maybe $300ish out of pocket for the new combo, less whatever they can get for the old combo. I think it is an upgrade worth considering. Gaming improvements at 1080p with an RX 580 may or may not be noticeable depending on your friend's display refresh rate and game selection, but literally everything your friend does on their computer will be and feel faster. I felt noticeable gains going from a 1600x to a 3600, so coming from haswell the difference should be even bigger.



That said, there is a compelling reason to consider holding off on an upgrade right now. We're not too far from DDR5 platforms according to rumors. Zen 4 may support it, and Samsung is allegedly gearing up for mass production of it in 2021. From that perspective it doesn't make a lot of sense to get into a DDR4 platform while it is nearing EOL as the mainstream best option. I had a 2500k I was content with and planned to continue using it, skipping DDR4 entirely and going straight to DDR5. The issue was my motherboard died so I was forced to upgrade. A 4690 is still a viable gaming cpu at 1080p these days, as is a 2500k really (caveats assumed that not all games run really well and details may have to be turned down, but they'll generally play ok enough).

So does AMD. AMD has charged more than Intel at times when it could get away with it. AMD's current top end HEDT CPU is $4,000. Intel's only at a quarter of that. When the Core i9 10980XE paper launched, AMD's top end (at that time) 3970X was $2,000. It's entry into the HEDT space was already $400 more than the 10980XE. On the mainstream segment side, AMD's top offering is more than $200 more expensive than anything Intel has. Now, on the AMD side you get more performance than Intel offers in everything but gaming above and below the 10980XE. Even where Intel is competitive, it's often still more expensive. For example, the Ryzen 5 3400G is less expensive than the Core i5 9400K. The 9400K is a good deal better, APU vs. iGPU not withstanding, but you do pay more for it."

Uses:

1.  School work.  I'm doing a masters program, so lots of word/excel/usual bullshit for school work; multiple screens of sources/etc, but it's all ""light"" work that anything could do.

2.  Video editing.  This is for work-work and my personal blog.  Technical demos, whiteboards, all recorded via a nice professional mic and logitech webcam (and zoom), and then editing them together.  Transcode it, upload to youtube/website.  Still building this all out.

3.  Gaming - I have a dedicated gaming system, but from time to time I need a break from whatever I'm doing on #1, so I fire up subnautica or UT for a bit to build things or shoot things, depending on how I'm feeling.  

4.  Transcoding.  Plex server feeding, basically - from raw data.  

5.  VMs for programming/fiddling/whythehellnot.  All minor side-project things, 1-2 at a time, one Windows 10, one linux, one ~sometimes~ plex server on BSD for fiddling.  



Looking at either a 3900X on x570 w. 32G, or a 3960X on MSI Creator.  Cost is about double for the TR setup; trying to decide if the extra horsepower is worth the extra $1700 or so (mobo/CPU+RAM/cooler).  Tend to normally buy systems for 3-5 years; before the Ryzen I had a Bulldozer setup, replaced that in 2018.  This is early only because I have the itch   I'm justifying it because I could leave a lot of whatever else running when I game if I upgrade.  And I want an internal BDROM drive, which won't fit in the current system (stupid case is stupid).

			I will answer this, although you didn't ask for my opinion. You don't need 12 cores... And even with the new consoles that comes with 8 core Ryzens, i don't think the 8 cores will be fully exploited, exactly because there is also the PC market that devs have to consider and companies are still selling new quads and they can't cut all these potential customers off. They will have to include them at least in the minimum requirements. The 3300X, in Battlefield, which i think can load 8 cores just fine, beats the 2600 which is 6 core.  By the time games really start to benefit from 12 cores, you will have upgraded your CPU 4 times.
		
		Click to expand...
	
I switched gears and started a 3300x build after seeing their performance per dollar and taking my current monitor setup into account.  I'm beginning to realize I'm not the hardcore gamer I used to be with the bankroll and desire to back up a high end build anymore and that the hardware scene and what you can do with lower budgets is pretty incredible compared to 10 years ago.    



Once the B550 motherboards (particularly the ASUS ROG Strix B550-E Gaming) come out it looks like I can have a nice 1080p 144hz rig together for just over $1000 which will have me reuse my existing chassis and PSU and throw in a EK waterblock down the line to replace the Wraith cooler.  Then maybe upgrade the CPU in a few years with a Zen 3 CPU if the gains/prices are good.

As this is my 1st Ryzen Threadripper I have seen with my eyes I realy dont know where to sart looking for problem.

So hoping for help from this forum and people who has more knowledge.



Also here is the short video of the issue."

			My Ryzen 2600 idles at 36C (39C with browser open), with ambient at 27C. CPU fan at 1400RPM out of 2600RPM max. I would suggest better cooler and if possible, put a small fan to blow on the VRM of your motherboard, because speaking from AM3+ experience, the heat from the VRM, ultimately spreads also towards the socket, heating the CPU itself and your motherboard has no heatsinks on the mosfets. And it has 3 mosfets per phase and probably not the best mosfets either. My PC doesn't have good case ventilation, it is geared for silence. But the motherboard (MSI B450 gaming plus), has 4 mosfets per phase, big VRM heatsinks, i use Scythe Katana3 as CPU Cooler and i have one 60mm fan blowing on the VRM and 1x100mm 1000RPM slim Scythe fan blowing at the back side of the motherboard. Old habbits from AM3+ times that die hard but pay off a lot...

May I ask what version of HWMonitor you're using? Because the clocks tab looks different than mine. Is it because of the motherboard? Also, look at my clock speeds, they're much higher than yours and I'm not doing anything except browsing this forum.

			ht as well test it out now. Launch a Prime95 and see what the VRM temps are like on your current rig with a fan in both positions. In theory it should improve VRM temps because it should guarantee that there is airflow around the heatsink, but you never know.

So I moved the fan the 2 inches over and there's literally no difference in VRM temps.  I can definitely say that ambient temp has gone up, so i'm gonna consider it margin of error.  I do think that more hot air is being exhausted out of my case, so that's potentially a good sign.   Either way...

			You will need to update your bios right before you install the Ryzen 3900/3950. The new bios will not support your 1700. I learned this the hard way.

So - this is my plan.



https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/Fatal1ty X370 Gaming K4/index.asp#BIOS

I'm on 5.1 right now - I update all the way to bios 5.4 on my 1700, the last one before the ""summit ridge cpus are not reccomended on this BIOS"" but also the first bios that allows the 3900X



https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/Fatal1ty X370 Gaming K4/index.asp#CPU

Switch out my CPU to the 3900x, make sure it boots (which I understand takes a couple cold reboots and can take a minute)

then update my bios to 5.5 and then finally 5.8?

After that and i'm expecting some memory tweaks I should be good to go!



Aside:

Why was the Ryzen 3900 never allowed for retail?  That CPU would have been perfect for what I need.

if it boots and all the memory shows up then it was probably just a ground pin and shouldn't be an issue, i just wouldn't try doing some insane overclock but other than that it should be fine if it's stable once you're able to actually test it.

I honestly never overclock so that shouldn't be an issue at all. The only thing i saw when in BIOS was the voltages fluctuated a bit up and down, but didn't seem too radical. .002-.005. Also should be noted there wasn't a cooler attached so that could have caused it as well I guess.

			AMD is already faster than Intel in several areas.



Wtf are you guys even talking about with all this dour and negative bleh blah?



2700x is only 9% slower clock for clock than the 9900k in avg.



2600x is also capped at around 4.2 ghz. Intel is another 7 to 80p mhz faster.



AMD is already faster per clock when weighed evenly against Intel.



But you guys dont want to see the inconvenient truth.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Even if Intel retains it's single-core speed advantage (which I'm not convinced it will,) the 3700X vs the 9900K makes the 9900K look like the huge ripoff that it is.



AMD showed one of their 8c/16t products narrowly beating a 9900K recently. Even if that's a little skewed, even if the 3700X is a tad slower in single thread, it's still a 12c/24t processor with the same clock speed, 150% the cores and threads, way lower TDP and a 7nm process, at 60-70% the price if speculation is accurate. Intel's about to get a kick in the teeth."

I think that's a great choice. The 3600X is the best gaming CPU AMD offers right now especially at the prices its going for now but the 3700X is just as good at gaming but with a couple extra cores should you need them. The 3800X performs barely 2-3% better than a 3700X but costs $50+ more! Definitely not worth it for performance difference you'd never notice on anything other than a benchmark.



So yeah, I think the 3700X is the best of both worlds. Great at gaming and muktitbreaded tasks too and since they're going for $280 or so, it's hard to go wrong with them. I've had mine about a month now and I've been very happy with it."

If the money is burning a hole in your wallet, go the 3950x, but honestly I think you would generally be hard pressed to see the difference between the two in what you do beyond benchmarks.



To give you a point of reference, I have an old i7-4790 in my server running about 8 vms who’s load is much higher than you are intending, sure it has 32 gig of ram, but it could get by on about 16.



It may, and I stress may, be worthwhile considering a 1650 for NVEnc on the box as a secondary card if you’re doing a lot of encoding, for the power savings if nothing else."

			I'm not defending Intel's actions. They have a tendency to replace their motherboards and chipsets far more than is actually necessary. However, there are positive things that result from that. The people that complain about changing motherboards are often the same people who come into the forum and make threads about replacing their CPU and not being able to flash it, or asking about AMD CPU compatibility, because its not as cut and dry as they thought it would be. These same people also find that there may be additional limitations of memory clocking or that their old budget boards don't support some of the features that the new CPU's do.



When we are talking about $150 to $200 motherboards, I generally couldn't care less about having to replace the board to get the best possible computing experience and the most out of my new processor. When you are talking about $600+ motherboards, then I think we are well into constant motherboard changes being an issue. Of course, the more expensive motherboards didn't make as many compromises in their designs and using a newer CPU with a high end motherboard that's a generation old often comes with fewer problems. The weird thing is that the people who buy the ultra-cheap motherboards tend to be the ones that don't want to replace their boards. The ones who have the $600+ motherboards are often the ones who will replace it each time there is a new chipset to get the latest features, the best memory clocks, and the best overclocking.



But when you change motherboards and chipsets each generation, you avoid the pitfalls of requiring an old CPU to even get the system to POST with a newer CPU. You avoid your BIOS ROM being to small to support a broad range of CPU's. You get up to date VRM designs and implementations that generally allow for better overclocking of modern CPU's. You also get the ability to clock RAM higher than you might on the older motherboards with those newer CPU's. Modern power savings features often don't work on legacy motherboards. The list of disadvantages goes on and on. Intel broadly avoids all that crap. If you match up the socket with the CPU you are normally good to go. Intel's had broad socket compatibility in the past and the same problems AMD's platform has were all very much present. It has also had artificially short life spans for chipsets and sockets and occasionally people have found enough evidence to call them out on that.



You pick your poison, but whether you were tired of buying new motherboards or not, there are plenty of valid reasons to go either direction. Personally, even with AMD's broad socket compatibility I opt for newer motherboards. I've even replaced the motherboard without replacing the CPU in order to gain access to newer platform features when there was something there I wanted. Of course, this was largely back when Intel's CPU's were stagnant and there was far more innovation on the motherboard side. These days CPU's are moving forward again on the AMD side, so it's largely had reasons to upgrade each generation while Intel hasn't.

If you start that, you really want to make sure you upgrade to something with a decent VRM if you want it to last. It might last on a cheap board. Sometimes they'll surprise you, but I would upgrade for piece of mind if I was running a cheap X370 board.

No, it's not the same. It's not even close. The power consumption, TDP ratings and core counts are quite a bit lower than a 3900X or 3950X. The demand on the VRM's are vastly different as a result of that."

			i'm going to say asmedia probably screwed the pooch on this one.. i think AMD should of just bit the bullet and released their own b550 chipset after asmedia failed to deliver b550 when it was suppose to. but i'm going to guess they already invested to much money into it to just walk away from the contract. i still have a sneaky feeling that we'll end up seeing some b450 and x470 boards supporting zen 3 unofficially by claiming the bios is ""beta"" so then they can pass the blame on the customer when something doesn't work right. was really popular from board partners back during phenom II when a lot of the old am2 boards supported phenom II using a beta bios and there was no point in contacting support for help if you had that bios installed.

Well, I mean, I think AMD actually raised prices back to the release prices of Zen2.  I'm pretty sure the current pricing was in the form of official price cuts.  I doubt the ""official"" price of the 3900x is still $499.  I'm pretty sure I read that it was $420 now.

Note: These are mostly at 4k with my 1080ti.



Pretty much any Ubisoft game, especially with Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, Hitman 2 - there was a weird stutter that existed on the 1700 that's absolutely eliminated now. Much, much smoother and average framerates did go up along with massive improvements in minimum framerates.



Monster Hunter World: Definitely didn't expect that I was CPU limited here, but my previously slightly inconsistent 60fps is now almost perfectly consistent. It's hard to apply numbers too, but overall just FAR better.



In one of the few games I do care about FPS, I can finally go over 110FPS in Doom Eternal is now around 150fps. at 1440p. HUGE increase there.



The biggest improvement for me overall are Frontier's games, Planet Zoo, Planet Coaster, Jurassic World Evolution, etc. My framerate went from 25ish in big parks to 40-50. More than double. I play these games a LOT and this is more than worth it for me.



Cities Skylines, frustratingly, is still around 25 FPS in my biggest cities. It's a more responsive 25fps but still just a sad 25fps.



If you have a title that you'd like me to test in particular, let me know.  I own the obvious free to play stuff like Fortnite and Apex Legends, PUBG, etc. but I don't play them that often.  I am curious if PUBG runs any better, maybe i'll reinstall that one...

What was the ""equivalent"" Intel chip selling for?  What was the same chip line selling for 2 generations ago. There is a reason Intel had to slash prices on the 10900x by half compared to 9900x.... Because they realized they couldn't compete and keep charging their premium.  It's tough to really compare ethough since AMD completely moved the goal posts, you can now get a consumer CPU with 16/32 and a HEDT with 64/128... But honestly the 3950x is more along the lines of older HEDT chips and a 3990x is more than you got with most Intel server chips.  I still feel their prices are reasonable for what you get.  They are a company and have to make money and they are publicly traded so have to keep investors happy."

Otherwise the AF is an exciting part that should enable many existing lower end AMD builds to progress to a 6c/12c state faster than at previous price pts.  It is a viable upgrade for Intel builds that won't fixate on 9700xx/9900xx bc B450 is cheap enough to equate ""for the price of z390 the end user gets a cpu"".

Not quite.  Earth ground isn't necessarily there, and really isn't (or rather shouldn't be) a functional part of the power system when it is.

		Click to expand...
	
The Wraith Stealth is NOT more than capable of handling the 2600, even the Wraith spire is junk. If by your definition ""capable"" is cooking at near thermal junction under load, then sure it is. Both coolers have the same crappy performance as Intel stock HSFs have had for the past 15 years.




	
		
	


He uses the Ryzen 5 1400, but both that CPU and the 2600 have the same 65W TDP. Under load, the CPU is cooking at a nice 88C with the Stealth (the cooler the OP has) and just a bit less at 84C with the Spire. You may argue that the figures are under thermal junction, but CPUs do not like running that hot and tend to get unstable. It certainly doesn't do the motherboard any favors, nor the capacitors around the CPU socket. The CPU may also be throttling when that hot, but no figures are given for clock speed.



Both the Stealth and the Spire have no business on a CPU that draws more than 45W. The only really decent stock AMD cooler is the Wraith Max or Wraith Prism, which are basically the same cooler, but the latter has RGB.

			Another thing to note here: idle temps are really not that important whatsoever. Pay more attention to temps under load. Your temps under load are abnormally high, closer to what one would expect from a gaming laptop. Of course you can buy a new cooler, but that misses the point!

Idle temps are most certainly important. The higher the idle temperature, the small the margin you have to thermal junction. 50-60C idle is something that should be left in the past with crappy aluminum coolers we used to have to deal with because better options weren't widely available."

Nope ... 2080ti is good at one thing in editing and that is outputting a final video with a shittier quality than a cpu.



My 3960x is just as fast as my 2080ti quality wise in Davinci Resolve studio. If I crank the quality up in Davinci my CPU is slower than the 2080ti but the quality shames nVENC.



Nvenc uses virtually no CPU at all unless your using AVISynth for cpu decode. Why? Just use Cuda for both.



You can get the same nvenc performance on a Sandy Bridge from 2012 or a 3950x from 2019. Lanes done mean shit, cpu just needs to run storage fast enough to feed the gpu video data.



Nvenc and cuda are like coin mining. 1x pcie lane is all you need and cpu is a lightweight brain.



Cpu is going to make a huge difference in doing editing tasksand ram is even more important than that in the big picture.



This is a general statement but

Video editing is not handbrake lol

Adobe Premier and DResolve is editing.



If all one is going to do is Handbrake then GPU is all you need. But real editing you need gobs of cpu and ram and a fast gpu is highly rexommended for offloading tasks.

I maintain my earlier statements, both intel and AMD are both valid choices, it just depends on what you use the box for.

6.12.3930 on the left, 6.27-4185(apparently 6.27 is out of beta now) on the right, also note that HWinfo still can't actually detect the multiplier below 33.6x even though you can see the displayed effective clocks which match ryzen master other than it not being able to show which cores are actually parked. HWinfo's good but it's only as good as the information being reported to it. 



i'd actually be interested to see what it shows for faethon's effective clocks since i can't actually access my other system and try the newer version of hwinfo on it since i'd have to disconnect everything from the work PC that's currently there(stupid work from home crap, i want my flight sim back grrrr..)"

			I find the biggest motivation to replace older servers is the power consumption.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Yeah, my server averages 140-150w.  So lets say 150w * 24 = 3.6kw per day.  I pay 11 cents per KW/h (less at night, but it's the average) so 365*3.6 = 1,314kw/h * .11 = $144.54 per year (~$12 per month)

Lets say a ""new"" server will average 1/2 the power (not sure on a real #, I really should look up power figures for newer stuff but it's hard to find especially when the load changes).  So I can cut my bill by about 1/2 so now my running cost is $75 per year a savings of about $75.  If I can build a new server for $1,000 (lol, yeah right) it'd only take me 13 years to recoup my money....



Ok, lets pretend my new server would use zero power (which it won't)... and the new one will cost me $1k.  It would still take 6.9 years to pay off the new server.  I just don't see how power savings add up enough for this to make sense.  Everytime I look to upgrade I'm reminded it's not really netting me much.  So basically until my work load goes so high that I am at 300+ watts and I can pick up a server that can do that work @ 50w for under $1k, I don't see how it would make any sense.  I've done the math, I understand that large companies that have servers churning 24/7 and pay high costs for power it makes sense.  For my server that does a little bit here and there, ramps up when i need it and goes back to idle.  I just can't make the #'s work to justify it.  That said, I will eventually get a new server when I feel this one is getting to old to support my needs or a new need arrives, but every year or two I check and see what's available and realize it really won't net me much just cost me $.

I figured as much, was just saying you can get an idea what they're going for so when you're building you know if you're doing ok.



MY Dell R710 was loud too... some reason the fans didn't spin down as far as they should at lower speeds.  Common complaint.  I wrote a C++ program that checks the CPU core temperatures every ~10 seconds and adjust the fans through the IPMI interface, since Dell decided the fans should not be correlated to temperature at all I decided to fix that .  Now my server is very quiet when at lower powers or short spikes but will ramp up based on my custom fan curve in my app.  My server sits in my dining room.  My kitchen is between my dining and living rooms and there are no doors between any of them.  I thought about going another route (new fans or custom fan controller with one my microcontrollers) but was able to get the data from the MB for CPU temps and manually control fans through the IPMI interface/tools and it no longer bothers me at all.  The fans used to sit at 3,000 RPM at idle (they run over 12k at full speed).  Now they are around 1500 and very rarely break 2000.  When they do it's because I have a sustained load and even then I rarely see it break 3k, which was idle speeds prior.





My power monitor:  Average 147w over the last week, which is typical.

			Honestly, I would still have got the 1600af if the 3300x was available at purchase.  In gaming, you will really only see a difference running $500+ gpus at 1080p.



Performance for that $ range (gaming), (productivity)

1600af - 7/10 : 10/10

3300x - 9/10 : 8/10



The extra $40 on a gpu will go much further on midrange builds.  It certainly looks like the 1600af is gone for good now though.
		
		Click to expand...
	


Yeah, thanks for making me feel better. I keep telling the same to myself... However, many of those ""productivity"" tests are benchmarks that don't apply in real life. For example, i decompress files that are several GB. I 've never seen 100% CPU use. The 3300X is faster in Lame encoding, browser, zip compression (!), Gimp, photoediting, MS Office. That's pretty much all the real life production applications. The 1600AF wins in decompression and synthetic benchmarks... The other amazing thing with the 3300x, is that it doesn't seem to be hampered even in games that are notoriously very multithreaded. I would expect that it would show weakness in such games, since a thread isn't the same as a core. But it keeps stomping the 2600 and the 1600AF even there and goes neck to neck with the 3600!



My greatest consolation is that i try to think that ""you can do more tasks at the same time""... 



About games, you 're right. I 'm not a big gamer anyway, i play a few old games for the most part, which unfortunately, some of them tax the CPU a lot...  But, i guess i shouldn't complain. I bought the 2600 and the 1600AF while they were still at good prices... The AF is still available here in Italy, but price has gone upwards, as have the prices of everything pc related (about +15 EUR for everything) and there is an obvious shortage of motherboards. Amazon is littered with ""out of stock"" models for almost every sub-100EUR motherboard... Covid19 effects..."

			So,



I was recently forced to replace the Supermicro motherboard on my server (see sig) and even with the one I ebayed, I am now seeing intermittent hard freezes. (once every ~14 days or so)



I was holding on to the current server for a long time due to the fact that I already have my 256GB of registered ECC RAM, and I wasn't looking forward to rebuying it all in DDR4, but maybe it is time after all.



Anyway, I started playing around with the idea of moving from my old dual socket Intel server with two 8C/16T chips, to a single socket 16C/32T EPYC.



Then I started looking around for parts.   Supermicro motherboards seem to exist at somewhat reasonable prices, but EPYC CPU's seem to be going for more than list price everywhere I can find them.



Is there a secret to finding them at the right prices, or is there a shortage, and this is just the way it is?



Much obliged

What are you doing with that thing?  I have 2x L5640's (6/12 each) with 96GB of registered ECC and it barely ever breaks a sweat . Was thinking about setting it up as a software rendering farm for Blender, but honestly I'd be better off buying a few GPU's and offloading. I'm probably going to end up replacing it with a high end zen or low end threadripper, I just think EPYC is overkill for my needs, but always curious what people are able to put together. A single Ryzen 1600 gets about the same multi-core score as my dual xeons. I just bought my son a 3700x for his computer which would walk all over my current server. Every time I think about upgrading it, I remember... it just works and I really don't have a compelling reason. Anyways, just making a post and listening in for some suggestions because you never know .  That link to servethehome has a few lower priced deals.  Finding 'upgrades' isn't a half bad idea, they are the same damn chip, lol, they just call it an upgrade for one of their systems.

yes. When gaming. I'm 100% positive it's not 50W consistently, and 100% positive it's not running at 5ghz consistently either as, as mentioned, I have speedshift enabled and adaptive voltage enabled. And I'm sure too that even when I'm video encoding it's not running 5ghz constantly either. Read my thread here: https://hardforum.com/threads/quick...6xxx-7xxx-8xxx-9xxx-10xxx-processors.1996926/



I daresay many if not all reviews don't have HDC or Core parking enabled, and some won't have speedshift or all C states enabled either.

That makes sense.  I had built a handful of Intel systems over the past decade and was not familiar with AMD quirks and the whole LGA vs PGA concepts.  Also, regarding the heatsink removal, I took the approach of starting with the stock heatsink to see if the cooling performance was acceptable.  When it was not good enough, switched to the tower cooler.  Had I gone straight with the tower cooler the issue would not have come up."

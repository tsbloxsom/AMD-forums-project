			From Phaszr

I'm opening up more Vanguard beta tester spots, and am reaching out here on Discord right to the AMD community! Keep in mind I won't be able to accept everyone for various reasons but if you are selected you will get an email or a reply in PM from me.



Step 1: Apply here (if you haven't already): https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/radeon-software-testers



Step 2: When you've done that (or did it before), PM me your GPU(s) and your email.



Step 3: Profit if selected.



Please remember this is an NDA'd program and your involvement requires radio silence externally about our specific activities. You can definitely mention you are in Vanguard of course! We get to play with cool stuff and you have direct access to speak with AMD engineering and marketing through myself and many AMD staff in the discord. I want to stress this is of course volunteer stuff, so don't treat it as some sort of work. I never want it to be that way. If you want to help me help everyone when we post a driver to the web, and get those sweet bug fixes early, apply. Don't like something in the software? Want to make a suggestion or feedback straight into AMD engineering, through myself? Apply. I'm looking for active and friendly members.



We've grown into a tight community with mutual respect for each other. I have zero tolerance for racism, sexism, bullying, etc. You'll be removed. Thanks!

This is open to all AMD GPU users though. We use Discord, and we usually have weekly driver builds for all products, even mobile. There is a dedicated bug reporting channel, which is moderated by AMD, and is a fantastic resource. PM your email address you used to sign up with your GPU model and I will get the info over to the correct place."

AI making first big splash into games. Combined that with Nvidia Amper generational improvements will be a tall order for AMD. Unless AMD has something brewing to counteract.

AMD took a back seat for AI hardware designs and software, relied upon traditional hardware and open source software development.



AI has great potential to transform about everything computer, software development,  gaming and I don't see AMD there. As for ray tracing, we may not need it, AI could figure out the lighting way better and faster in the end. Some huge quantum leaps maybe coming for everything dealing with games."

This just means you still have A short somewhere.  How did you determine which MOSFET it was that needed to be removed?



If by shorted, you mean that you have 0 ohms to ground between the positive and negative side of those capacitors, I would try removing the corresponding low side MOSFET on the suspect phase as well.  Failing that, you need to hunt for the short, which is hard to do without pretty sophisticated lab equipment."

Finally figured out why the demo looked so off and not impressive besides the rather cruddy frame rate. While the demo shows different types of reflections, curved surfaces, flat, uneven, rough etc. None really looked that great compared to typical raytraced images. THE BIGGEST thing I now notice was there is only one level of reflections. Objects that are reflecting, virtually everything, when seen on a reflective surface have no reflection in them -> reflection of a mirror of a mirror in other words would be blank and not showing each other reflections. Obviously in this demo you would have to have virtually infinite number of rays to calculate reflections of reflections (typical raytracing you would see this to a good level), at least 2 levels of reflections would probably have made this demo looked better."

			Up to 50% performance/watt gain but how much of that will translate to actual gaming gains? Doesn't seem like a 2080 Ti killer but maybe as fast or slightly faster at best.

			Kind of my take. They didn't actually talk about performance. Also, they indicated this is coming towards the end of the year. Meaning it's likely AMD could be releasing after ampere. Once again we have AMD trailing and Nvidia open to charge whatever they please.

That performance/watt came from note RX-325:

""RX-325:Testing done by AMD performance labs 6/1/19, using the Division 2 @ 25x14 Ultra settings. Performance may vary based on use of latest drivers, RX-325""



While it is good seeing that is an actual game being used but not much more is indicated. Was it done at the same frame rate? Power level? In other words there is a lot of wiggle room to explain less than 50% 200w RNDA compared to 200w RNDA2 gaming performance. Note the date, 6/1/19, which would seem to be an early engineering sample. Sufficient time to get production cards going I would think, so why don't we see any? My best guess is TSMC capacity which is expected to open more in June. Of course cororavirus can really affect things here."

			at 899 it would have to be GDDR6.. HBM2e is expensive as fk and AMD likely learned from their mistake with vega/vega 7nm that HBM has no purpose for gaming. now that they've split their consumer card line up from their enterprise lineup the new instinct cards will probably have HBM2e and RDNA 2 cards will probably have 14gbps GDDR6 with hopefully a better memory controller to allow higher memory clock speeds.







consider it more of a proof of concept.. if RDNA 2 actually works and is competitive then they know they're on the right track which makes it much easier to release RDNA 3. no point in swinging for the fences based on rumors with zero context to them.. they just keep throwing around the 50% figure but still have not said whether it's ray tracing or raster performance, for all we know the 3080ti is 50% faster at ray tracing but performs exactly the same as the 2080ti in games that don't support ray tracing.

			DirectX Raytracing 1.1

DirectX Raytracing (DXR) brings a new level of graphics realism to video games, previously only achievable in the movie industry. The effects achievable by DXR feel more real, because in a sense they are more real: DXR traces paths of light with true-to-life physics calculations, which is a far more accurate simulation than the heuristics based calculations used previously.



We’ve already seen an unprecedented level of visual quality from titles that use DXR 1.0 since we unveiled it, and built DXR 1.1 in response to developer feedback, giving them even more tools with which to utilize DXR.



DXR 1.1 is an incremental addition over the top of DXR 1.0, adding three major new capabilities:




GPU Work Creation now allows Raytracing. This enables shaders on the GPU to invoke raytracing without an intervening round-trip back to the CPU. This ability is useful for adaptive raytracing scenarios like shader-based culling / sorting / classification / refinement.  Basically, scenarios that prepare raytracing work on the GPU and then immediately spawn it.
Streaming engines can more efficiently load new raytracing shaders as needed when the player moves around the world and new objects become visible.
Inline raytracing is an alternative form of raytracing that gives developers the option to drive more of the raytracing process, as opposed to handling work scheduling entirely to the system (dynamic-shading). It is available in any shader stage, including compute shaders, pixel shaders etc. Both the dynamic-shading and inline forms of raytracing use the same opaque acceleration structures.
When to use inline raytracing

Inline raytracing can be useful for many reasons:




Perhaps the developer knows their scenario is simple enough that the overhead of dynamic shader scheduling is not worthwhile. For example, a well constrained way of calculating shadows.
It could be convenient/efficient to query an acceleration structure from a shader that doesn’t support dynamic-shader-based rays.  Like a compute shader or pixel shader.
It might be helpful to combine dynamic-shader-based raytracing with the inline form. Some raytracing shader stages, like intersection shaders and any hit shaders, don’t even support tracing rays via dynamic-shader-based raytracing.  But the inline form is available everywhere.
Another combination is to switch to the inline form for simple recursive rays.  This enables the app to declare there is no recursion for the underlying raytracing pipeline, given inline raytracing is handling recursive rays.  The simpler dynamic scheduling burden on the system can yield better efficiency.
Scenarios with many complex shaders will run better with dynamic-shader-based raytracing, as opposed to using massive inline raytracing uber-shaders. Meanwhile, scenarios that have a minimal shading complexity and/or very few shaders will run better with inline raytracing.



If the above all seems quite complicated, well, it is! The high-level takeaway is that both the new inline raytracing and the original dynamic-shader-based raytracing are valuable for different purposes. As of DXR 1.1, developers not only have the choice of either approach, but can even combine them both within a single renderer. Hybrid approaches are aided by the fact that both flavors of DXR raytracing share the same acceleration structure format, and are driven by the same underlying traversal state machine.



Best of all, gamers with DX12 Ultimate hardware can be assured that no matter what kind of Raytracing solution the developer chooses to use, they will have a great experience.

I have bought a used MSI RX580 OC Armor that worked fine for a couple of weeks until I have noticed that it was overheating while playing (88-90 C).

I have put some new thermal paste and the temperature is back to normal, however for some reason if the card is not installed

at an angle like in the photo, the BIOS will not detect the card. I have the same problem if I put the card in another PC.

The PCB is curved. I made an attempt to straighten it by installing a plexiglass but the card will not be detected (hence the spacers).

I can still play games, but sometime the system will reboot because the card is not detected.

It seems like a bad contact somewhere. I have looked at the card but nothing is suspicious.







Has anybody have any idea what could be wrong? Could it be bad solder under the GPU?

I cannot claim that the issues I have had are indicative of all Radeon graphics cards, this is just my experience and maybe it will help others. 



I originally had a reference 5700xt with an ek waterblock that I installed. This was in october and everything worked just fine for the few days I had it running. I was getting hotter than normal temps with the cpu so I thought I had a bad cpu mount and took the loop apart. During this time the Liquid Devil was released and I just could not resist that beautiful block, so I made the purchase. Had some issues with the build not related to hardware so it was some time before I got it reassembled. This is where my issues begin.



I vertically mounted the block, used DDU in safe mode to clean drivers and did a fresh install of the newest adrenaline software/drivers. I got immediate black screens on startup. I thought it could be background apps like steam and epic so I disabled them on startup. Seemed to do the trick so I fired up Outer Worlds and found my clocks locked at 300 mhz and also almost instant game crashes to desktop then quickly followed by black screen. I then did a fresh install of windows installed drivers and again same results. I remembered that I had read some people needing to set PCIE to 3rd gen in bios due to the riser cables not handling the signal. I had paid a premium for riser cables that advertised 4th gen readiness so I hadnt thought that would be a problem. Luckily my bios had that option so I did that and that cured the constant crashing, or so I thought. Launched OW and I was still locked at 300mhz, and I got a crash after a few minutes. I ran AIDA64 stress test and got a hardware failure on the memory test. My memory was stable and stress tested before the AMD 20 drivers. I am not overclocking anything just had vanilla xmp profiles enabled to get advertised speeds. Went into bios disabled xmp profiles and saved. The pc locked up and I could not get a post. Luckily, again, my mobo came with a clear cmos button so I did not have to take the loop apart to access the battery. Clear cmos did the trick, I set fan curve, set pcie to 3rd gen, left memory alone and booted into windows. No crashing, ran Deus Ex and OW and still locked at 300 mhz. I now began the process of running DDU and walking back drivers, which was really annoying, until I found a release that didnt gimp my card. That was 19-12-1. So everything apears to be working fine now, accept for my underclocked ram, but obviously this was not an ideal or great experience. I am actually really disappointed that I cannot use the new adrenaline software because I liked the included ingame overlay and like the idea of a unified suite where I dont need msi afterburner. I want to stress that I cannot say that the new drivers had a hand in my ram suddenly becoming unstable under xmp, but it did happen right after so I had to include it. I also wrote this in hopes that some that are having issues due to riser cables, and don't know it, will now know to set pciex16 to 3rd gen instead of auto in bios. I really hope that AMD fixes the 300mhz bug soon, I do like the software."

New games are still coming out with just DX 11  but DX 12 Ultimate that came out this year will make everything that don't support the few features obsolete by the end of this year . Some, I actually do believe, think that somehow Turing will start performing much better in ray tracing and the the 2060 will be pouncing away with RT 2022 games at 200 fps-> Reality is all those features will be virtually worthless for any intensive future game, 6gb way to small and even 8gb will be asking too much, 2080 Super and down . They will depreciate like the cards before them taking up space in a garbage can . Well cards in general may indeed start performing with a form of raytracing much faster than current generation and not even using dedicated RT based fixed function units, Unreal V and/or Crytek game engines which may make those 8gb 5700 way more hot than those 6gb, less bandwidth 2060's.

Some quick tests and I'm getting 60 fps at 4K max settings in Battlefield 5, Far Cry 5, Prey, DOOM, and Wolfenstein II.



I might not even need to overclock, but I will take a look today and see how much headroom there is.



I will say that coming from Vega 64 Crossfire, this is a significant improvement in smoothness in some games (for example, Prey and Far Cry 5 that were choppy before).



AMD finally has a card for 4K gamers and the price is not too crazy considering the market. AMD has delivered.

Nice, sounds like a decent card despite all the complaints against it. I know we say this all the time, but, I think it will improve over the next few driver revisions. Once they get those early teething issues sorted it will move from been a decent card to a great card. Once the stock improves prices should improve too. $649 would make this card a really good buy.

Then on ray-tracing, I think they might surprise us. Well, we know both next-gen consoles have ray-tracing, and AMD must have found a way to make it work, maybe more efficient than Nvidia has so far. So this could be a big win here.



And then price. I don't know what they are targeting, but $1,200 or even $1,000 I think would be a miss. I would guess $799 for the top end, and then moving down from there. I hope they can pull it off."

			To me, AMD pricing is set high so later they can lower as needed. Their cards look economical to produce, with great yields at TSMC on 7nm, so AMD appears to have a lot of leeway. Frankly, take AMD's whole lineup and deduct $50 from it and that to me would be the right price. Since Nvidia has higher prices there was no need for AMD to constrain the AIB partners profits which help support AMD in the end anyways. It is not just AMD but partners as well that are looking for a profit. As for the 5600XT, that would be a very hard sell to me, I would get the 5700 on sell, 8gb ram, 256bit bus, OC's very good while the 5600XT looks like it does not have much left after the bios update.

AMD's 5**** series has been a much better price/performance than Nvidia, since launch day last summer. 5600XT is a little closer in price. But, it is still priced better.

...nevertheless, the short answer is no.  Your problem would likely not be the hardware, but rather the software that wouldn't be compatible.  You would need a BIOS image for the card that includes provisions for the the larger capacity memory ICs, including the proper timings, which are probably different.  You may be able to create a hacked bios image for a 200 series card that would work, but I suspect you'd be in mostly uncharted territory.



Then you get to the driver issues.  It's hard to say whether or not the drivers would play nice with a 285 with more memory, but I don't think it's a safe assumption to assume that they would, even if you could get a BIOS image that allows the card to address the extra memory properly.



It's a vastly better solution to just use a newer card and some sort of adapter to provide VGA support if you're hell bent on running a CRT for some reason.

			Guys,



I have to say that I've read enough negative comments on community.amd.com that I'm seriously re-thinking this decision.  The really scary part is that some of those posts are like just a week old and they say that the drivers aren't really stable yet.  I like that the 5600-XT is comparable to GTX for a lot less money, but I also like reasonably stable and trouble-free drivers.   



My heart wants to get an AMD card, because I don't like nVidia, but I head keeps saying that I need a reliable system.

If the last few years have taught us anything, waiting isn't always the best policy. People were waiting for the 1080Ti to drop in price then the mining craze hit, then they were waiting for Turing, but those cards were priced super high and the 1080ti prices stayed high. On the AMD side things haven't been much better, Polaris was supposed to be cheap, but was over $200 apart from a few limited cards, then Vega which was $599 and $699 for the Vega 64 and liquid cooled models, apart from the limited numbers at launch offer prices of $499 and $599. 



So who knows what will happen with prices when the next generation cards arrive."

my system spec -

4x16 ram corsair lpx



i9 9900k



Asus vega 64



hx1000i



3xhdd



2xm.2



corsair commander + 6 fans



Noctua dh CPU cooler







- Mobo Bios latest -  F9b (also happened with F7) tried default settings and my Hackintosh version bios, no difference.



- AMD Latest driver 20.5.1 (also happened with the ASUS officially driver from their website and the AMD stable version 20.4.2)



-  Windows 10 20H1 version



- Power connected with 2 different cables to PSU



- I set my PSU to a multi-rail mode in iCUE software, also tired with single rail mode, no difference.



- tried 2 sticks of ram, swap them, 1 stick, no difference.



-  I did MemTest86, everything fine.



- tried different profiles on ASUS GPU Tweaks, also tried to change the bios from the card dual bios option, no difference.



- tried to update the firmware from ASUS website,  no difference.



- tried to update the firmware from https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/ , again, no difference.



- temperatures are fine, around 70-80 Celsius







really don't know what to do or try, Asus support told that they can't do anything, and I can send the card to them, but I must to use this card for my working OSX machine, so I want to try to point on the problem.







I want to try to replace the thermal pad and change the thermal paste to try again and check if there are any temp issues, like in this post 





please help!

Well, I own the exact same card, an RMA replacement that I bought from someone on here last September,  and I have had zero issues with it. My guess is because it already has the proper thermal pads already installed. Therefore, I would do that, if you have had the card for a few years."

			Wow! New games are still coming out with just DX 11  but DX 12 Ultimate that came out this year will make everything that don't support the few features obsolete by the end of this year . Some, I actually do believe, think that somehow Turing will start performing much better in ray tracing and the the 2060 will be pouncing away with RT 2022 games at 200 fps-> Reality is all those features will be virtually worthless for any intensive future game, 6gb way to small and even 8gb will be asking too much, 2080 Super and down . They will depreciate like the cards before them taking up space in a garbage can . Well cards in general may indeed start performing with a form of raytracing much faster than current generation and not even using dedicated RT based fixed function units, Unreal V and/or Crytek game engines which may make those 8gb 5700 way more hot than those 6gb, less bandwidth 2060's.



Anyways next gen for GPU's/Consoles are right around the corner, if you want the newest feature set, that will be a good place to start. Like it is for every generation.

I'll be so glad, when AMD catches up on features, so AMD fans no longer feel the need to defend/rationalize AMD lack of them.



Some features are performance boosting features, like DLSS, Variable rate shading.  Things that will make a 2060 have a longer lifespan, than a 5600.  Both of which have 6GB of memory BTW."

			Hello.

Right now I have, practicaly, no video card. I paired a 3700X/32GB RAM with a XFX 8500GT. So no gaming for me.

I was considering picking up this card, but since MSI AB can't handle the fans and there are several issues with Wattman, I was wondering if I should wait for big navi, considering that the RDNA2 will introduce new features. I know it may take like a year to have big navi with AIB coolers, so... what do you people suggest me to do? (Of course, i'm aiming for 1440p gaming and a card to last for some years like 3 at least).

It looks like you only upgrade your GPU every few years. In your case I would say wait for the next round of Navi cards. The current AMD cards don't support Ray Tracing and won't support most of the features of DX12 ultimate.

xx60 and xx70 are just names.

Performance is what determines if a card is ""high end""

Not saying that the 5600xt is high end, but literally the 5700xt is the ""highest end"" AMD has at the moment. But if you compare that with the 2080Ti then you would say the 5700xt isn't as high end.

Also, I consider anything above $300 as ""high end"".

There are some people who would consider the 2080Ti as not ""high end"" as there are better and faster products such as Quadro and Titan"

			It is not my opinion that Navi is obsolete because it really only has features from previous generation cards/consoles.

DLSS is Nvidia propertiary solution so it may never really become mainstream. It is however already supported and will be supported by various games. What is maybe even important is the hardware behind it which will allow any similar feature to be enabled.



Navi simply does not offer anything that Turing has.

It does not even have anything new that OP did not already have with Pascal card...

Because it's late in here, I'm going to get some rest and make measurements tomorrow.

You're right about the new fuse - it's dead too. It was a good fuse so I hope it did its job and protected the circuit. I'm not expecting to fix this card but I want to try it anyway, because as I said - I love to learn and because of this failed GPU I already learned a lot, and there's more. Much more 

I got the card as brand new. No one used it before me. The air in here is dry/very dry, though I can't  ensure that this card didn't get a drop of water while doing something with / next to the PC. Though it's not likely.

I don't have any more photos because I cleaned these spots with alcohol and they look brand new now. These are the only (old) pics I got.

			Hi everyone!

I'm new here and I come because I hope you can help me.

I have Gigabyte RX 460. Few months ago it stopped working. I didn't have time to check what's really going on.

It doesn't work and isn't detected at all. I checked that fans are still working (if you give them some juice directly). I checked the fuse that is next to PCI - is dead. It may be this one element (or more), though it's a good starting point. But the problem is that I have no idea what kind of fuse is this? Can you help me and tell what fuse should I buy?

My assumptions are that it's 1206 SMD element and because this card is powered only through PCI it's something like 5A or 6,3A (*12V = 60-75W - what in theory PCI can provide). Though I'm not so sure if I'm thinking correctly.

This fuse is called F3 in the picture and there're no signatures on it.

That looks like a 3216 package SMD, although I'd have to measure to be sure.  I'd guess you want something like a 7A, 24VDC rated part (12V parts don't seem to exist in this size).  Plenty of options on Digi-Key and mouser.  It's hard to say what an exact replacement would be without seeing the part in person.  I'd be surprised if it really has no markings at all, but I can't see any in the picture.



You have, potentially, two problems here.  One is that the fuse is apparently open.  The other is that you may have a short through the board or something elsewhere.  Check the major voltage rails for resistance to ground before you go replacing the fuse or applying 12V to the card - this was apparently a semi-common issue on the RX 400 series cards, but if you haven't fixed whatever caused it to fail, you'll just damage the card worse.



If you don't feel like repairing it yourself, I might be interested in buying this card from you.  I make threads (and videos for Youtube) about repairing dead graphics cards from time, and I'm always on the lookout for new ones to work on.  I'm sometimes even successful."

Both have driver issues, that is why new drivers are coming out all the time. For any consolation, I am having no major issues with my 5700 XT, issues yes but nothing remotely detrimental for me. I have issues with Nvidia drivers too, nothing too serious. I've seen flips over and over again on who had major issues. I would say in general Nvidia is better but not significantly and I like AMD drivers better for overall functionality and usefulness.

Thanks.  I find this post interesting, because a lot of the ""bad Radeon driver"" posts include some comment about how they never had any such problems with their previous card, which was nVidia.



So your post has me wondering if a 5600-XT would be a good choice despite all the negative reviews.This card is already overclocked by AMD, but I wasn't going to try to push the card any faster.  My current monitor is 1920 x 1200 at 60 Hz and I'm not planning to upgrade to 4K until I can afford a monitor that supports aRGB, which is pricey.



Now, in case I didn't already say this, I""m not a gamer, and I had the impression that a lot of nVidia driver issues are game-related, but the AMD driver issues seem to affect even Windows.  Yes?  No?   I'm running Windows 10 Pro 64, latest patches, etc.  My main workaday applications are Microsoft Office (heavy Outlook,Word, Excel, a bit of PowerPoint and  Access), and Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.  If it matters, I was probably going to get the 5600-XT,"

If you have zero ohms between BST and the phase output in the circuit shown in your picture, I think there's at least as good a chance of a failed phase control IC as there is a failed capacitor.



Edit:  If you have a short to ground on that pin, it's almost certainly the IC, and not the capacitor.



Edit2:  Looked again.  If you have zero ohms between BST and the phase output, try removing the bootstrap capacitor and see what you get.  If you still have zero, it's the IC, not the cap."

I'm still looking for a limited edition, watercooled version to purchase.  I purchased a limited edition XFX black Vega, but I'm not opening it in hopes of a watercooled card.



A friend sent me this vid yesterday.  At least we can purchase these cards with our eyes wide open at this point.  Two key takeaways from the video.   Rise of the Tomb Raider felt smoother on Vega than 1080ti - even running 20fps less.



And the overclock profile uses nearly 100 watts more for a measly 2% more FPS.  He said AMD shouldn't even have created a setting like that.

Right now I have the RTX 2080 ti, I do play 95 % flight simulators at 4k.

Main reason I'd go for AMD? Try not to laugh :

dithering.

I have some color banding, and I can't find a way to fix this

It's pretty annoying especially when I fly very close to the clouds

Last year I purchased the AMD Radeon VII and I didn't really give it a good test

Sent it back because of the poor performance

I did fly X-Plane 11 at that time ( now, too ) but meanwhile, X-Plane 11 updated to Vulkan and a lot of users, even the developers, encourage to buy AMD cards

Second flight simulator I play is DCS World

And 2, 3 others but the next one, which comes later this year, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 would be the greatest, and I have absolutely no idea about which GPU would be the best choice : AMD or nVidia

When I tested the AMD Radeon VII, last year, with X-Plane 11, I was a bit disappointed about the performance but I was really surprised that the color banding disappeared 90 %

The clouds and skies were looking amazing

That's the reason why I asked about AMD

I own right now, 4 different 4k TV's

1 Samsung Q9FN 55 inches - amazing TV. Maybe the best Samsung TV, in the history of the TV's    

1 Samsung Q90R 55 inches - amazing TV, as well. Very hard to compare it with Q9FN

1 Samsung JS 9090 55 inches - older model but it's not bad

and the TV in the living room, Panasonic 75 inches,I'm not sure about the model - didn't really use it as PC monitor. Just some short testing

It's hard to believe, all of them has color banding

I even tried with more than 10 different nVidia drivers

No go.

I also tried with :

1 RTX Asus Strix 2080 Ti

1 RTX MSI Trio 2080 Ti

1 GTX Gigabyte 1080 Ti

1 GTX Gigabyte 980 Ti

Changed 4-5 different HDMI 2.0 cables

Installed Windows 10, fresh

Played with many different settings in nVidia control panel, TV settings.

Hundreds of different types of settings

Couldn't find a solution

I was even thinking about installing Windows 7 on the Z390 chipset. It's possible but it requires a lot time, PS 2 mouse and keyboard for the installation, PCI e card with PS2, etc

Thank you, I'll keep searching for the best solution

After all this, I came to the conclusion that the main culprit for the color banding, is the nVidia software"

There’s no intellectual capital in DXR. Its concepts have been common knowledge in the graphics industry for decades. The secret sauce is in the hardware implementation and nvidia certainly didn’t share that with AMD.



And of course it’s in everyone’s best interest to define a common api for raytracing (DXR/Vulkan RT). Just like for any other graphics feature that you want developers to use.

			Just out of curiosity .... why would you sell your 1080? Nothing wrong if you're a diehard AMD fan or maybe you have an AMD branded PC? They do sell AMD cases, memory, SSD's .. you could have a Ryzen. That all makes sense.



If not, you're not gaining any performance and it's going to cost you more electricity. I would do additional research before you go through all of that. Good luck on whatever you decide.

I dont have brand preference. I do have a ryzen 1700 because it out performanced my 3570k and for what I do professionally, Its better then the 7700k. I do use it for gaming though as well.  I want to sell my 1080 because of freesync. I own a 75hz 34"" 21:9 monitor and I had a 390 and freesync was very noticable when I first got it. I sold my 390 due to mining prices and sat without a GPU for awhile and jumped on a 1080 when i got a steal of a deal. Everyone including reviewers are saying how awesome freesync is is awesome and worth it. Its been awhile since I've had it infront of me but im willing to take a small loss in certain games for the smoothness. Also I think everyone agrees to a certain level that AMD does have a ""fine wine"" standpoint where we might see a bit more power down the road.  Im willing to cough up the 599 if I can grab a silver one."

			Just that you can get right now on Newegg different 5700's for $329, put a 5700XT bios on it and OC it to much higher levels then any 5600. It also has 2gb more memory, more memory bandwidth which for NAVI is needed. All for $30 - $40 more and cheaper than some of the 5600 ASUS ones. I don't see the price of the 5600 as good, $249 starting price would have made much more sense with special AIB cards being less than $300. Also 5700 have gone below $300 at times on sell. I don't see why you don't get it.

			What do you mean ""develop for RDNA tech""?

What are the killer performance improving features of RDNA2 which Turing does not already have? I highly doubt DX12 ""Ultimate"" would be released just before cards were released with even more features that needed extensions...



Besides, PS4 and XO had GCN GPU's with such killer feature: very efficient asynchronous compute capabilities. Nvidia cards did not properly support it for a long time and it still made no real difference so...



I really hope ray tracing performance of RDNA2 does not suck and is actually much better than Turing. If not then it will just hinder ray tracing implementation in games and it will be used to a lesser degree. Maybe more extremely optimized but as we already saw with ""dynamically loaded textures"" bullshit from PS3/X360 era these extreme optimization techniques do not always translate well in to PC world and definitely do not contribute to overall quality of games.

Yes, performance much better than Turing since Turing has pretty much sucked with RT gaming from a performance prospective, lack of real innovative games or games where one would say -> I want that!.



Minimum for RT should be like 1440p 100fps+ with max or near max settings and RT, 4K 60fps+. Preferrably 100fps+ at 4K but even normal games can't even achieve that for the most part with even a 2080Ti except maybe Doom Eternal and older games."

If you look there, you'll see a pretty common single phase VRM design.  The bootstrap capacitor is CBoot.  One side is connected to the phase output (between the MOSFETs and the coil), and the other is connected to the controller's bootstrap pin.



Remember that the core VRM on this card has four phases, each with its own phase controller, so you'll need to figure out which pin on the phase controller is the bootstrap pin and use that to determine which capacitor nearby is the bootstrap capacitor."

List of things I've tried:

updating the drivers with device manager, using the ones windows automatically finds

updating the drivers with Radeon-Software-Adrenalin-2020-20.1.3-MinimalSetup-200128_64bit

updating the drivers with Radeon-Software-Adrenalin-2020-20.1.4-MinimalSetup-200127_web

updating the drivers with Asus 18.10.16 WHQL

updating the drivers with the AMD Driver Auto-Detect Tool

updating the drivers with the drivers amd recommended to me when I selected my GPU on their website

Every option on the Windows 10 Recovery screen (restoration point - roll back - the rest), the one thing that makes my PC usable again is booting into safe mode, and I've tried rebooting out of safe mode with the faulty drivers installed but they still don't work.

Running AMD Driver Cleaning Utility before installing any of the aforementioned drivers

Installing drivers after running Display Driver Uninstaller

Booting into low res mode

formatting my PC and installing the drivers in a fresh windows 10



I remember that my card came with a CD which I think contained the GPU Tweak II program and maybe some drivers, but sadly I don't have the CD anymore.



I currently do not have access to another PC where I can install my GPU to try it and neither do I have another GPU I can use instead of the one I currently have.



Also, when I open up Photoshop CS6, it detects that there is something weird going on with my GPU. League runs at 2 FPS at max settings when it used to run at 120+ and some games like Dead by Daylight won't boot up because a message pops up telling me that DX11 is required to run it. My point is that other programs are aware of the driver change and it's not like I can just keep using my PC as if nothing happened.



It seems that no matter which version of the drivers I install, I always have the same problems:

During the driver installation process, the screen blacks out and never comes back, when I reboot my PC, after the ASUS logo screen where you can enter the bios, the screen displays a pixel glitch which covers up the entire screen.



I guess if I could just go back to the drivers the GPU comes loaded with, that would solve the problem, since I've been using those since July 2018 with no problems and great performance.



Oh also: After installing any drivers, when I reboot into safe mode my GPU shows as either Radeon 550 Series or Radeon RX550 depending which driver I install, even though the GPU name's is correct, League, for example, still runs extremely slow (20 FPS with the lowest settings). Also, my GPU never shows up on task manager even though it used to before all of this happened and it still shows us as Microsoft Basic Display Adapter when I run dxdiag.exe. And as I've previously said, if I were to reboot out of safe mode into ""normal mode"" I would still get the screen glitch, the only way to go into normal mode without any glitches is to roll back to drivers with device manager to ""Microsoft Basic Display Adapter"", however, that renders my GPU useless since it won't process anything."

Exactly.  I would have gladly bought a 2080Ti at $800 at launch.  At $1199?  Get bent, Nvidia.  A year and a half later you still have to spend $1199 unless you want a poorly binned, poor boosting card.  $300 for a mid-range 6GB card AFTER a price drop?  Ridiculous...  I'm not spending $300 for a 1080p card.

Whining about AMD drivers unless you're using them with each regular release is getting about as old as me whining about Nvidia's pricing .  I've actually had more problems with Nvidia's drivers than AMD's in the past year with crashing to the desktop and having to reinstall games and delete config folders just to get them to work with each new Nvidia driver release.  I have had zero issues with the newest 20.2.2 driver."

			The problem is you have no control over how the sim is coded, one cannot use a vidoegame as a calibration reference.  Your visual fidelity is only as a good as the source.  I recommend getting a colorimeter such as a Spyder and calibrate your monitor.  Second the quality of 4K and 8K varies depending on source.  Use my link to the video below to look for banding, the Red system is well over 100K with the lenses.

I've had dithering issues with 1080 Ti's when using HDR. They would do 8bit + dithering vice HDR 10 or 10 bit. It was very noticeable, noisy in Shadow Of The Tomb Raider. What was weird was if the monitor was set to the monitor 144hz refresh rate it would use 10bit. Any other refresh rate vice the default refresh rate, the driver would enforce a dithering mode. This was before adaptive sycn was supported by Nvidia and I was using adaptive Vsync and was trying to lower the refresh rate to match up to the capability of the 1080 Ti's, mGPU. It seemed when it was using the right 10bit mode, performance was lower then with the dithering modes, if this is due to any limitations to how Nvidia does color or any other type of compression I do not know. In any case it was very noticeable to point where it did make a difference. Ended up getting the 5700 XT due to support for Freesync 2 is better and putting a 4K on the the SLI rig. The 1080 Ti's will probably end up on a TR build in progress and I will be able to test this out with the newer drivers. As a note, Vega's never had a banding/dithering mode enforced and has always looked better color wise over Nvidia (maybe just a default driver setting better suited for me)."

			Removing components on the 12V rail to find a failing one doesn't sound like fun. So I would need some proper power supply to look for hot components and then hot air solder to replace them. I was thinking about power supply and hot air for some time now. I will need to look on the Internet if there's some power supply (probably not a laboratory one) + hot-air that I can afford. But it can end up with a dead-end as I could not afford two of those things at once.
		
		Click to expand...
	
A lab power supply is exactly what you need.  You need to be able to set both the voltage and amperage limit, or you'll just damage the card worse.  You can generally make do with a cheap one, but you do need it to do basic lab power supply things.  You'd obviously need hot air to remove SMD components.  I'd set this card aside until I could get my hands on all of the tools if I were you, but the hot air station is what I'd get first if I had to choose.  The power supply is only used for fairly specfic diagnostics."

Some board partners will have it listed in the specs like ""2-slot"" or ""2.5-slot"" and so on (EVGA does this). Others will use inches/mm measurements, which in my experience 2-slots (or less) is no more than 40mm. I think it may get a little complicated when the measurement also includes a backplate, which doesn't necessarily cause problems when there's a slot limitation."

			Are you guys happy with your purchase overall?



Just curious, with a factory non water cooled Radeon 7 with a closed mid tower, what kind of temps are you seeing while gaming ?



For example, in my Corsair c70 mid tower with my Strix 1080ti, highest temp I’ve seen is 72c while playing PUBG @1440p with ultra settings. Completely factory fan settings/curve
		
		Click to expand...
	
Very happy.  I'm getting around 76c peak temp when OC'ed (110c peak junction). It overclocks well and is super stable, and is actually fun to tweak (moreso than any card I've owned for years).  The more I play with it, the more I'm confused with the complaints on the noise: it's nowhere near as loud as some other cards I've owned.  Actually, the more and more I use it the more I agree with [H]'s assessment: it's a very good card, definitely worth the ""silver"" badge.



Only reason I'm not over the moon is, from a performance perspective, it's only marginally faster than my 1080 ti (not that I was expecting anything different). If I was coming from a lower card e.g. GTX 1080, Vega 64, I'd be more stoked."

			If you're hitting upper 60s/70s I'd say it's definitely worth it even if you aren't OCing. The only issue is if you mind voiding the warranty. I wouldn't mess with liquid metal or any conductive TIM. Good old AS5 is working fine on mine.



One thing you can do that would help without needing to remove the warranty sticker is place some thermal pads in the spots on the underside of the backplate.









I've found GPU overclocking to be useful when you are looking for a few more guaranteed FPS in a given game. For example, if you're aiming for a consistent 100FPS but averaging 97, upping the GPU core and/or memory can gain you those last few frames. If your FPS is wildly fluctuating then GPU OCing won't be able to make up the difference.

Thanks.  Since I have just a Vanilla 5700 from Sapphire, no back plate exists for it.  I know eventually, just because I like to screw around, I will probably do the washer mod and just use the thermal paste that came with one of my Noctua CPU coolers."

There are resistors and capacitors on the board close to every driver but they are not connected to BST.

If by shorted, you mean that you have 0 ohms to ground between the positive and negative side of those capacitors, I would try removing the corresponding low side MOSFET on the suspect phase as well.

Unbelievable to me.  And disappointing to be sure. Sentiments coming from a tremendous Fury X crossfire fan who had a stellar experience with the crossfire tech.  I'm still looking for a limited edition, watercooled version to purchase.  I purchased a limited edition XFX black Vega, but I'm not opening it in hopes of a watercooled card.



A friend sent me this vid yesterday.  At least we can purchase these cards with our eyes wide open at this point.  Four key takeaways from the video. 



Rise of the Tomb Raider felt smoother on Vega than 1080ti - even running 20fps less???



Second - The reviewer has used freesync for the last year + and he said he tested both models on a non adaptive sync monitor -- he continued that his experience with Freesync on a RX480 and RX580 over the last year has been better than the 1080TI  or Vega on the same games with a non adaptive sync monitor.  He said between the two cards he'd take freesync with vega over a 1080TI and a non adaptive sync monitor - easy choice.  I feel the same way.



Third - And the overclock profile uses nearly 100 watts more for a measly 2% more FPS.  He said AMD shouldn't even have created a setting like that.



Fourth - DX12 games ran better than their DX11 version on Vega, while DX11 games ran better than the DX12 counterpart on 1080TI.  Which is what we saw with 980TI vs. Fury X continued.  Overall he thinks the 1080TI is about 27% faster than watercooled vega."

I could always do it dirty way and solder + and - to the power supply 



When I'll get down to test the card. I suppose I should start with 12V and give it as little amperes as possible at the beginning. Have the circuit shorted with a fuse ""plugged in"" and give it some time to warm up. What's the good starting amount of Amperes? 500-1000 mA?

			FANTASTIC THREAD!



Some of us would ditch the card but fixing it does give a lot of knowledge and seeing it in action is very cool! Usually after an electrical component potentially failed as in a piece of controlled equipment. I try to smell everything I can, touch everything I can (of course de-energized, capacitors discharged etc.), look for anything burnt. This usually can lead to what is causing the issue and any subsequent collaqual damage hopefully. The fuse should have protected most components. Actually supplying current flow to unknown cause other than a power rail going to ground somewhere I've never done before, which hopefully leads to the faulty component(s) becoming obvious without causing any further damage.

Getting in the 55 fps range, which can be acceptable with FreeSync, but this type of game really needs low latency and smooth framerates.



Managed to tweak things with a mix of settings (mostly High and Ultra with a few Medium) and got to a good place (between 60 - 75 fps).

at 899 it would have to be GDDR6.. HBM2e is expensive as fk and AMD likely learned from their mistake with vega/vega 7nm that HBM has no purpose for gaming. now that they've split their consumer card line up from their enterprise lineup the new instinct cards will probably have HBM2e and RDNA 2 cards will probably have 14gbps GDDR6 with hopefully a better memory controller to allow higher memory clock speeds.

I'm not playing games. This card was too powerful for my needs. I used it to calculate stuff. They definitely won't fix it after my soldering 



The story of my Gigabyte RX460:

There was a card. Graphics card. It didn't have hard time. It played Witcher 3 from time to time and calculated mathematical stuff. It liked Linux and Linux liked it - no drivers necessary (starting with the Kernel of the number I don't remember). But it wasn't hanging only with Linux. There was another bud - Windows. They were hanging together quite a lot.

Everything went fine, new drivers were stable. I ""underclocked"" it by 10% with Wattman settings and the card never exceeded 40°C and was using very little juice. Very shy and quiet type.

But... because AMD's new drivers weren't able to correctly handle OpenCL 1.2 that I needed. I had to install the latest, but ""no so stable"" version of drivers that handled OpenCL 1.2 correctly (WHQL 17.9.3 to be very specific). With those drivers my card worked only fine, because my ""underclocking"" settings defaulted by themselves from time to time with a windows notification about something going wrong about the driver and setting it to default.

So one day I had this task for my card. ""You're going to calculate this for me while I'm hanging with my friends"". And so it began. Room temperature on this day 28°C. Time to complete the task ~3-4 hours. I was back in about 7h and the screen was blank. The system still worked. Restart... nothing. Look at the card and very fast diagnosis - dead.

What happened? No idea. Is it my fault that I was calculating stuff on it? Probably.

			That looks like a 3216 package SMD, although I'd have to measure to be sure. I'd guess you want something like a 7A, 24VDC rated part (12V parts don't seem to exist in this size). Plenty of options on Digi-Key and mouser. It's hard to say what an exact replacement would be without seeing the part in person. I'd be surprised if it really has no markings at all, but I can't see any in the picture.

Maybe it's under the fuse. I would need to desolder it, though hard to do with just an iron solder.








	
		
			
				RazorWind said:
			
		
	
	
		
		
			You have, potentially, two problems here. One is that the fuse is apparently open. The other is that you may have a short through the board or something elsewhere. Check the major voltage rails for resistance to ground before you go replacing the fuse or applying 12V to the card - this was apparently a semi-common issue on the RX 400 series cards, but if you haven't fixed whatever caused it to fail, you'll just damage the card worse.

That's a good next step to do. Check resistances.

I couldn't find any really helpful guidance that would inform about what to do / check in the failed GPU.

I would love to help you with new ""dead bodies"" for autopsy, but I'm the kind of person that would spend $100 trying to repair this card, rather than spending $100 on a new one and be done with it  I'm living my life to learn. 

And I'm from Europe anyway. This card would need to fly quite a distance 



Because this GPU gave me a reason to actually buy hot air solder I would like to try and repair it. Successfully or not - that's a great way to learn  I'm into electronics anyway. But programming AVR/ARM isn't really that hard and didn't require me to have SMD soldering skills.



I have some pics of the suspicious spots on this card. I cleaned these places. Now when I think then yeah, probably at least one element need replacement.

4 pins are from the fans connector and 2 pins belong to the capacitor that I guess is 820uF and 25V (or 2,5V)."

			For clarity... Did the blackscreen problem start BEFORE you installed the Radeon VII (highlighted section above)? Your post sounds like it happened with the RX 550 installed and continued happening with the Radeon VII after the 550 was replaced...
		
		Click to expand...
	


I has flashed a non mining bios back to the 550 and when it went to restart it would happen.



I removed the Ssd, tried it in an external USB 3.0 in case the sata controller went wonky with no luck.  



I ended up formatting the SSD on my main rig.  I reinstalled the 550 and saw the flash had failed (windows was giving a code 43).  Reflashed and it works great.



I return the 550 and SSD to the Athlon system, and it posts and starts windows install just fine.  I finish, install 19.2.2, and power down.  I removed 550 and put RX VII in. Post fine, black screen...Hard power off, same issue.



I try 550 in second slot (set it to primary adapter) with the same results.  Normal post and black screen.  Remove 550 and try just VII in second slot.  Same result.



With my BP soaring at this point due to pain, I remove VII and installed 550 to see a normal boot and return to windows.  At this point I have to assume that the old AM3 board is just too old. 



I have decided to use this for HTPC duties, break my loop down and remove the vEgas, close the loop, and then do a 24hr stress test on the VII on air to get some data and make sure the card works fine.   I will then I stall GPU block and vrm cooling and getto OC'ing.  



I am just  frustrated since many of you know I suffer from severe chronic pain issues.  I spent 30 hours in bed the night before and all day yesterday after PT.   Loosing hours today set me back yet again.



What sucks the most is that I have an open PCI-e 16x slot but I cannot get the VII in without scratching that beautiful HSF and hitting my pump....it's just such a tease lol.  See below.

Probably a good idea to re paste, since the temperature sensor is registering one part of the GPU, dried up paste can have uneven heat transfer so another part of the GPU could be much hotter than normal
Underclocking or lowering the Power Limit will reduce the heat load on the GPU, which will also reduce the heat load on other parts of the computer, all this will tell you if it is heat/power related to something


What makes you think it is the GPU?



You can pull the GPU and re seat it, other option is try the other PCIe slot for testing purposes. Another graphics card available to try?



What power supply do you have, how old, how many watts? Does the fan speed up when under load on the power supply? Keep it single rail, no reason I know of going dual rail.


As a note, I have a Seasonic 850w power supply on a 6700K plus 2x 1080Ti setup which now when gaming in SLI and both GPU's are working hard will do this as well, after about 1 year of mining 24/7 the Power Supply appears to have gotten weak. You could reduce the power of the GPU and then the problem goes away thinking it is the GPU when actually it is a weak power supply
If you have anything shorting, USB device, motherboard, GPU, card etc. most power supplies will automatically shutdown -> So your power supply could be protecting against a short or low ground
Heat on a component, motherboard itself warped and heat causing a short is not out of the whelm of possibilities
Take everything out of the computer, put it on a box and test using minimal cards, hookups etc.
Any extra power supply cables possibly grounding out? Look for odd things even something shorting out pins on the motherboard, blow out the computer with air, flip it upside down etc. - even shake it and listen for anything loose

Blow out the power supply, clean any filters, (most of my cases have filters for the power supply, one of them I have to actually take the power supply out to clean it! errrr)
Try a different power supply if you have one, currently new ones are very hard to find and/or very expensive
Anyways you have to isolate the actual cause"

Samsung recently announced 3rd gen HBM2e:

A single stack is 16gb and bandwidth for that single stack at 410gb/s with a maximum speed of 538gb/s. These are probably meant more for very high end compute/AI cards. Their Gen 2 HBM2E(Enhanced) was 8gb per stack, probably more suitable for a high end desktop GPU with two stacks and bandwidth around 900gb/s, which also Hynix also makes HBM2e. Will be interesting if AMD will have some HBM2e versions for the desktop for gaming, pretty sure there will be professional cards using it for the desktop to get the memory density/capacity up."

The high-side mosfets are a part of the VRM.  They're used to switch the 12V input power on and off, so that, when smoothed out by the coils, you get an average of whatever the Vcc for that circuit is - usually 1.0 to 1.5v on a graphics card.  When they fail, you end up with basically a wire going straight from the 12V input to output of the VRM, such that you have 12V being sent to GPU, which is about 8X what it's supposed to have.  When this happens, it usually kills the core."

I have to say that I've read enough negative comments on community.amd.com that I'm seriously re-thinking this decision.  The really scary part is that some of those posts are like just a week old and they say that the drivers aren't really stable yet.

My assumptions are that it's 1206 SMD element and because this card is powered only through PCI it's something like 5A or 6,3A (*12V = 60-75W - what in theory PCI can provide). Though I'm not so sure if I'm thinking correctly.

This fuse is called F3 in the picture and there're no signatures on it.

			I would stay away from all rx5xxx cards as AMD really has done a terrible job on the driver side of things. I have a Sapphire 5700xt pulse model and on both my systems, i7 8700(non k) 16gb gskill ram 850w corsair psu and i7 10700k 32gb gskill ram 1000w corsair psu, I have had random black screens and hard crashes with the only solution being a system reboot. I tried everything from updating drivers, removing the adrenaline software, setting the pci link speed to gen 3, fresh windows install and nothing worked.



My friend also has Sapphire 5700xt nitro+ and has the same problem instead he is using an AMD cpu. You are going to get people here who are going to tell you they haven't had any problems and that's great for them but the fact is that the rx5xxx cards still have problems and you will be rolling the dice picking one up. The only reason I haven't switched yet is because the new Nvidia and AMD cards are just around the corner so I see no point in buying any of the current gen cards at the current prices.



If you have to have a card now put the extra few bucks in and get a Nvidia card. The evga rtx2060 KO is pretty close to the price of a rx5600xt.

It's honestly not very audible over my other fans if you stick with the default fan curve (Phanteks fans: 1x 200mm, 2x 140mm, and 2x 120mm + Wraith Prism). IIRC, the default curve tops out at around 40%

More memory, wider bus, more shaders, can really push the card towards 5700XT levels. The cheapest 5600 XT on Newegg is $269 which I would not recommend, talking about a roughly $30 difference here but a great difference in performance and potential. Other 5600XTs are $279+ making them even less worth it compared to a well priced 5700. Couple weeks ago 5700XT (reference model) were being sold for $349 at Dell which is more costly but also has more potential.



Now if I had only two choices, a 5600XT or 2060KO, I think the KO would win out. The performance between the two are close enough but the 2060KO has way more features that maybe will be usable. Except a 5700 would win out every time at least for me at this price range."

decision.  This card does have the BIOS update available for 14Gbps (if it's not already on it).



This will be paired with a Ryzen 1600AF CPU (probably will be replaced by a 3700x in the near future)

32 GB 3200 ram

Asrock B450M Pro4



It will be replacing a 1060 3GB.

			We do not know what AMD will have with Arcturus architecture efficiency or Nvidia next gen Tesla GPU's. We do know that Nvidia has sound and highly used software stack that support their hardware which AMD does not seem to have. Only way I see AMD competing with Nvidia is to sell much lower to allow college students, engineers, scientist etc. a very affordable potent card to use to get their development and user numbers up. This would not be overnight. Nvidia also has AI servers that one can rent for deep learning so one does not even need to invest heavily into a rig.



AMD, my opinion, maybe needs to think very big/wide/long term here for data servers. Hire some professional teachers/programmers/video producers and give out a lot of training to ease those professionals into using AMD eco-system. Like Apple virtually owning desktop publishing for years even where their hardware was second rate compared to the PC side, video - once folks get use to an eco-system and able to perform tasks and get the job done -> it becomes really hard to now retrain, convince, buy new software etc. to go to something else. AMD getting into separate unique markets like video editing etc. other fields requiring very high FP64 etc. would be prudent while also building up in markets already established.

I'd like to see AMD put together some sort of tpu core for AI research.  From my comfy seat behind my keyboard it just seems that AI processors are going to be the new cpu moving ahead.  Gpus have been adequate for many needs until recently when TPUs have essentially improved upon them exponentially from an AI deep learning standpoint.  This golden age of CPUs for AMD is great and all, but missing out on the next big silicon product for the future would be a big mistake."

So highly opportunistic here. 64CU should be close to a 2080 Ti and then 72Cu and 80Cu should be going against Ampere high end.

4. Memory - ~56 ohms



5. Memory controller - OK -  ~35 ohms

Pin 8 - 60 ohms 

Pin 7 - Infinity

Pin 6 - ~650

UP0104P SGA51N - I found so many datasheets but all of them are useless and not about this IC 

Pin 8 - ~1ohm

Pin 7 - infinity

Pin 6 - ~1k



8. 5V VRMs - UTC 78D05AL -  ~620 both

			Hi guys!



I had the same problem with my RX 460 from Gigabyte and I want to share my experience.

I got the card working by swapping high-side mosfet that was shorted and by replacing a blown fuse which is the origin of this topic.

It was running fine for 2-3 days and then suddenly today my PC shut itself off on idle and the issue is back. The same mosfet is shorted and the fuse is blown.

I'm guessing the real cause of the problem is hiding somewhere else - maybe one of the ICs? I have one last try left with this GPU because I bought 2 fuses and 3 mosfets.

What do you guys think gone bad?

There might be a similar situation with this GPU.

			Of course you can buy a better card for $50 more. And for $60 more than a 5700-----you can get a 5700XT.







5700 beats a 2060 super, for $70 less



5700XT beats a 2070 for $10 - $20 less and matches 2070 super in newest games, for $100 less.



And Nvidia has a problem right now where the 2060 super and 2070 are the same price, but the 2070 is strictly better.

DOOM Vulkan runs great, 60 - 70 FPS Ultra settings 4K. This is really nice.



GTA V getting around 50FPS mostly maxed at 4K. It's playable, but I'd probably have to bump down settings to hit 60 FPS.



Far Cry Primal 4K High settings, getting around 45 - 50 FPS. Almost playable.



Rise of the Tomb Raider 4K High. Not great around 40 FPS. 



Resident Evil 7 4K Very High. Around 45 FPS, almost playable. 



Borderlands maxed at 4K getting 60 FPS solid (V-Sync).



Batman Arkham City 4K maxed 60 FPS solid (V-Sync).



Dishonored 4K maxed 75 - 80 FPS.



If you are at 1440P or less, a single Vega would probably be enough. It's not quite there for 4K (unless you are OK with lesser settings or older games).



I think with the second card running I will be set. I know the driver's not supposed to support Crossfire, but I'll plug it in anyhow and see what happens."

No, not all the cards can do 14 GBps, I believe there were a few vendors who stated they would not be applying AMD's new BIOS since they  stuck with AMD""s original spec and shipped their 5600 XT cards with 12 GBps memory. See below.

It's on par with the 2080 in most situations at 4k.  However, in games at 4k with high vram usage, it keeps stable FPS while all 8gb cards will be all over the place.



It really can't keep up with a 2080ti at any resolution/setting in the majority of games.



In the end, the Radeon VII is still the best choice if a) you're playing at 4k, and b) you don't want to spend $1000.  This, couple with it's compute prowess is why prices for the VII have remained high."

Right now I have, practicaly, no video card. I paired a 3700X/32GB RAM with a XFX 8500GT. So no gaming for me.

I was considering picking up this card, but since MSI AB can't handle the fans and there are several issues with Wattman, I was wondering if I should wait for big navi, considering that the RDNA2 will introduce new features. I know it may take like a year to have big navi with AIB coolers, so... what do you people suggest me to do? (Of course, i'm aiming for 1440p gaming and a card to last for some years like 3 at least).

Yeah I get what you’re saying. I just don’t think that DXR itself was particularly helpful in designing hardware.



I’m sure certain hardware optimizations were possible given the constraints imposed by the DXR api but the core problems to be solved - ray/box intersection and ray/triangle intersection have been around long before DXR."

While I agree, I don't think we'll see this situation. Nvidia cards are going to cost more per FPS than whatever AMD brings out. You can all but guarantee it. As the market leader, Nvidia can get away with it. 



And while I know it comes up constantly and I'm not looking to turn this into another AMD driver thread, I do agree it's a problem worth factoring in. Every time I've given AMD a shot in the last ~10 years, I've regretted it. Most recently with a Vega 64. I bought it because I got it on sale for a much better price than the equivalent Nvidia card. I did not like owning that card. I'm keeping an eye on what they are doing, cautiously. I'm in need of a real 4K capable card, and at this point i'm not paying up for a 2080 Ti. If AMD comes out with a part that matches or bests the 2080 Ti in performance and massively undercuts it on price (under $800), I might give them a shot. If AMD really tried to match Nvidia in price/performance, be it with a 2080 Ti or whatever Nvidia has coming this year, I won't give them a second thought. I'd go as far as to say that at equal performance, I'd pay up to 10% more for an Nvidia GPU before I'd start seriously considering something from AMD. That's not because I'm a shill for Nvidia, but because I don't recall ever having a complaint about a Nvidia card I've owned. I can't say the same for AMD. It's a question of risk, and with what these high end cards cost, I don't like taking a risk. 



All that said, I'm eager to see if AMD has anything to show off today. Whether it's a card I'd consider buying or not, it'll still play into whatever Nvidia does this year... and I definitely agree that Nvidia also needs to be put in check before commas in GPU prices become standard."

Got a peak of 2024 core and 1280 mem, but the frequencies were changing all over the place. Temp peaked at only 75C, even with the OC. This card is way cooler than expected.



Afterburner doesn't seem to be able to read or adjust any values so I'm doing this in Wattman. Also means the in-game OSD isn't showing me GPU values.



Practically every game I tried was a noticeable improvement from Vega 64 Crossfire to Radeon VII.



The only game where CF was better was Rise of the Tomb Raider. I had to drop to medium settings on VII to get to 60 fps, but it still looked nice and was smooth.



Aside from Tomb Raider, I was rocking 4K max settings in many games:



Far Cry 5, Prey, Mad Max, DOOM, GTA 5, Resident Evil 7, Get Even, Batman Arkham City, RAGE, and Left4Dead (old, but I like to use it for testing since it loads so fast).



Surprisingly, I was able to play Deus Ex Mankind Divided with Ultra settings and it was playable at 4K. Granted, it was just below 60 fps (usually around 50 - 55) but this was okay with FreeSync.



When DXMD came out, I tried for about a week of tweaking to get it running with a Titan X Pascal and was only able to do it with 3840 x 1620 on High settings. The Radeon VII blows that away at max full 4K.



Maybe I'm missing something, but this Radeon 7 card is actually way better than I was expecting. I think Crossfire must have been broken and maybe I was suffering from microstutter or something along those lines.



Because almost across the board, the gameplay experience was smoother and more consistent with the new card. Even games where performance was higher with CF, the feel of the gameplay was improved.



Finally, OpenGL games work again. There was a strange bug with Vega 64 and CF, which caused GL performance to tank (to around 30 fps) if two cards were in the system (even with CF disabled). So now I can enjoy OpenGL again."

			Finally figured out why the demo looked so off and not impressive besides the rather cruddy frame rate. While the demo shows different types of reflections, curved surfaces, flat, uneven, rough etc. None really looked that great compared to typical raytraced images. THE BIGGEST thing I now notice was there is only one level of reflections. Objects that are reflecting, virtually everything, when seen on a reflective surface have no reflection in them -> reflection of a mirror of a mirror in other words would be blank and not showing each other reflections. Obviously in this demo you would have to have virtually infinite number of rays to calculate reflections of reflections (typical raytracing you would see this to a good level), at least 2 levels of reflections would probably have made this demo looked better.

Usually after an electrical component potentially failed as in a piece of controlled equipment. I try to smell everything I can, touch everything I can (of course de-energized, capacitors discharged etc.), look for anything burnt. This usually can lead to what is causing the issue and any subsequent collaqual damage hopefully. The fuse should have protected most components. Actually supplying current flow to unknown cause other than a power rail going to ground somewhere I've never done before, which hopefully leads to the faulty component(s) becoming obvious without causing any further damage."

On my R7 3700x with Vega 56 and R7 3700X with Vega 64, both systems run Batman: Arkham Knight without issues. (They have the latest version of Windows 10 2004 installed with 20.4.2 drivers.) Now, I had to redo my R5 3600 with RX 5700 system from scratch because the latest 2004 build caused an issue on that. (No biggie, just saying it so that it is clear that I am on 1909 build, instead.)



What happens is sometimes, the game with super stutter unless I exit out of the game and go back into it. A couple of times, the game crashed as well and once, rebooted the system. Yes, it could be a driver issue but, I figured I would reach out here, regardless and ask. (It is running on a 27inch 1440p 144hz Freesync monitor.) Now, just saying, I do have a display port cable issue because, if I move the end of the cable that is plugged into the card, no matter the port, the screen will go black until I unplug and replug the cable back in.



Any ideas? Perhaps I should remove and reinstall the driver or maybe try installed 2004 again? Also, I do have Corsair iCue installed on all 3 computers. I have not overclocked anything, although I do have the 5700XT bios flashed to the 5700 card but, I have had that since last September and had no issues prior to this. However, I also have not played BM: AK on this computer before the last couple of days, either.

The only reason I haven't switched yet is because the new Nvidia and AMD cards are just around the corner so I see no point in buying any of the current gen cards at the current prices.



If you have to have a card now put the extra few bucks in and get a Nvidia card. The evga rtx2060 KO is pretty close to the price of a rx5600xt."

A backplate is not a guarantee of no sag.  I had a GTX 970 that had a full metal backplate and it still sagged over time.  Not as bad as this, but still.

			Now this brings up an interesting point that I didn't think about.  This PC is not my dedicated box, it's more of a HTPC that I also game on.  But besides that it's also my Plex server.  Most of my videos play direct stream, but there are a few instances where it transcodes and the 1060 is very nice with that.  I looked briefly about AMD and their support with Plex, but there's sparse info.  I never would have thought of that if i didn't post here asking for opinions.

Nvidia is further ahead of AMD for transcode quality.  Both are supported by ffmpeg and plex, however I don't have a GPU in my Plex server so I can't comment to much how well either works besides what I've read.  You also need a Plex pass (not free version) to enabled hardware transcoding as well.  I mostly direct play and when I don't my dual xeons keep up fine.  My next build I plan to add hardware transcoding so my CPU do with have to ramp up and work so hard (aka, less power).  CPU has the best quality but I normally run lower quality on CPU so it doesn't use as much power (I don't care if my shows look perfect, so 720p 3mb/s is my normal target, but it will easily handle 1080p full quality if ask it to)."

Minimum for RT should be like 1440p 100fps+ with max or near max settings and RT, 4K 60fps+. Preferrably 100fps+ at 4K but even normal games can't even achieve that for the most part with even a 2080Ti except maybe Doom Eternal and older games.

What do you mean ""develop for RDNA tech""?

What are the killer performance improving features of RDNA2 which Turing does not already have? I highly doubt DX12 ""Ultimate"" would be released just before cards were released with even more features that needed extensions...



Besides, PS4 and XO had GCN GPU's with such killer feature: very efficient asynchronous compute capabilities. Nvidia cards did not properly support it for a long time and it still made no real difference so...



I really hope ray tracing performance of RDNA2 does not suck and is actually much better than Turing. If not then it will just hinder ray tracing implementation in games and it will be used to a lesser degree. Maybe more extremely optimized but as we already saw with ""dynamically loaded textures"" bullshit from PS3/X360 era these extreme optimization techniques do not always translate well in to PC world and definitely do not contribute to overall quality of games."

			VII is a grest card for work, and a great card for gaming if it is watercooled.  I don't know what AMD was thinking with the HSF design.  There is no reason it should not have cooled the car better without the fans running super high to get max gaming performance.



That said, they are super fast cards at 2050-2100Mhz and 1150-1200Mhz HBM.  IF you are gaming at 4k and want FreeSync (especially via HDMI) this is the best way to go.





I game at 1440P 120Hz on my 65"" Samsung with FreeSync so I picked up a Navi 5700xt AV ED that is going under water at the end of the month when EK ships their blocks.  I fully expect the card to stay at 1950Mhz or even higher doing gaming, which combined with a memory OC is going to make it even better!





It's a hard choice, but given that the VIIs are going to stop being sold, the resale market for them is going to climb nicely.  The 16GB of HBM2 and that FP64 performance is EXTREMELY DESIRABLE to prosumers.

			A backplate is not a guarantee of no sag.  I had a GTX 970 that had a full metal backplate and it still sagged over time.  Not as bad as this, but still.  On the flip side I've had video cards with heavy coolers and no backplate not sag at all.  The primary issue with this video card is the cooler isn't attached to the I/O bracket, as I mentioned above.

noko great advice and ill try to under-clocking the GPU and see how it will react. 

I did mostly all of them, I don't have a spare power supply to check, but I try to disconnect and connected everything again and try to see if I can point on something . this machine is one year old. Seldom gaming, only in the last four months I start to use the GPU more, so everything is still ""fresh"". 

My first thought was that the power supply might be causing some issue. Still, some people told me that the behaviour of my machine that crashed and rebooted immediately does not sound like PSU.. but I tried to check all the wires and people that build the same specs as I did, and I can't find any problem. I don't know how I can measure the PSU without external hardware... 



I'll try to make the CPU bench and see what's going on, about the GPU bench; I can't understand what do you mean? To make benchmark and change the values on the MSI burner or in the and tune section ? or just to check temp or stability ? in general, when I'm making the bench test for the GPU its pass every time."

			I'll be so glad, when AMD catches up on features, so AMD fans no longer feel the need to defend/rationalize AMD lack of them.



Some features are performance boosting features, like DLSS, Variable rate shading.  Things that will make a 2060 have a longer lifespan, than a 5600.  Both of which have 6GB of memory BTW.
		
		Click to expand...
	
lol, fan of true performance and not make believe. DLSS is very cool and hopefully will be implemented more, variable rate shading is an optimization which can affect visual quality, Radeon Boost is kinda cool but like DLSS limited to just a few games and Boost performance when rapidly moving the mouse which can also affect visual quality but is masked by monitor pixel response time.



If the gaming Ampere performance is similar to GA100 over GV100 we will most likely forget about Turing, rather quickly. AMD will most likely have a tall order to follow or short period of time leading unless they have some good surprises. GA100 in short is out of this world in performance jump if Jensen is even remotely straight about it. The performance from AMD should be strong we just don't know enough about either one at this time. Then again it is not one or the other, it can be both if they are both worth it. Turing just was never really worth it if one already had a previous generation high end card, never really performed well with the added feature set nor were there sufficient games to effectively use it. Assuming at some point in time a magical game will come along and just blow you away is probably what a real fan person blinded by a given emblem would propagate.



Now at the moment I wouldn't mind having a RTX card, playing Control on the RTX 5700 XT AE, getting around 65 FPS, 1440p, great game! The added effects from RTX would probably help with the atmosphere but if I had to degrade other quality settings that would not really get the ball in the hoop, DLSS 2.0 solved that for the most part I do believe. Of all the games I've played in the last two years that would be the only one in my view that it would be nice having RTX, Wolfenstein already looked great, ran great but probably some benefit with reflections using DLSS 2 to keep performance up. Of all the other games I've played, not having RTX made zero difference, in short Turing was never really enticing at least to me.



Next generation it maybe worth while having hardware RT capability, I still think games will be slow coming using it even on the next gen consoles. Any tack on after thought RT would most likely be BS and be pointless. Other more efficient ways for rendering, like Unreal 5 Engine can produce may win the day in the end."

The higher end professional cards and MI cards I would definitely expect HBM2e.



I just see most of the gaming cards except maybe a lower version of a HBM2e card  would be using DDR6, what Nvidia did with the 2080Ti was utterly ridiculous. With those prices I would expect most will just go with the next generation of the console which the XBox X should be faster than a 2080 Super. Which is a strong consideration, will AMD charge more for a card that performs less or equal to the next generation console about the same cost? Or performs slightly better? I see AMD having a good opportunity to pick up some large user numbers if they can price right, hit the manufacturing numbers needed with expected performance numbers. AMD is also aiming for a 50% profit margin up from 45%. So they are not necessarily looking at having historically lower prices but will compete with Nvidia price wise that will make sense.



I take the 50% perf/watt improvement using the least efficient Navi GPU -> Navi 5700XT, at 225w RNDA2 will perform 50% better at 225w, if that power envelope is expanded to 250w (if it scales linearly) 2.5/2.25 x 1.5 = 68% faster than a 5700XT. Any headroom beyond that will just be a plus. If AMD VRS is more efficient than Nvidia and more automatic or if newer titles on consoles that are available to the PC pretty much all use it, that will stretch the performance improvement.  Add in improved Radeon Boost that work with more games and particulary DX12 and Vulkan games will give a usable performance improvement which can be rather large when it counts. If Microsoft/Sony/AMD came up with efficient RT methods and software tools (which I would expect) RT rendering enhancements should be more widely used.



I see at this time Nvidia investment into Tech particularly AI may just maintain their lead and it could be huge. I expect Nvidia to at least have a 30% low side and more like 50% performance improvement. Combined that with working tech that can be easily be incorporated, DLSS (particularly if more automatic with driver updates for more and more games and developer support and updates). I expect Nvidia to expand upon RT tech and more notably new ways of doing things, most likely using their AI advancements, DLSS is only the first now successful implementation, I expect that to be much expanded and possibly blow our socks off. If so, then I don't expect prices be lowered that much unless AMD start kicking their ass in sells.



I see this year, depending upon world events as well, could be the most interesting, best year ever to be a reviewer/tester of gaming cards as well as professional cards. Maybe a year where everything you own you might just want to throw away."

I never implied that Nvidia directly shared any proprietary technology with AMD.

This isn't correct not even close. All DX12 cards support DXR. The difference lies in the implementation. Nvidia contributed no more to the API than AMD did.  



That's why I've said multiple times that's it's really disingenuous to say Nvidia developed  Ray tracing in games it's not true at all. Imagination has done more to put tray tracing in games than even Nvidia. 



What you can say though it's that Nvidia is the only one that ships hardware today that had DXR enabled. That's true. But more than that and you're getting into areas where it's just not accurate."

Also in regards to DLSS, 2.0 looks SUPER good and can deliver huge performance improvements. Very promising.  I'd probably scoop a 2060 at ~300 over a 5600xt. 5700 flashed to XT at $300 is also a good option if you just want lots of raw raster perf. for cheap.

			Here are my measuring results. These ""arrows"" that you've drawn really helped.



Measurements:

1. Across the fuse - infinity (of course)



2. 2-3 ohms - sooo... that's not good



3. GPU VCore - ~3 ohms



4. Memory - ~56 ohms



5. Memory controller - OK -  ~35 ohms



6. 3.3 V - non-zero (30 ohms)



7. Other:



RT8120D GSP3GJ2N - corner - I don't think I really understand the spreadsheet. Looking at the diagram I would say that only pin 8 is the output and the rest is used to drive it?

Pin 8 - 60 ohms

Pin 7 - Infinity

Pin 6 - ~650

UP0104P SGA51N - I found so many datasheets but all of them are useless and not about this IC 

Pin 8 - ~1ohm

Pin 7 - infinity

Pin 6 - ~1k



8. 5V VRMs - UTC 78D05AL -  ~620 both





Looking for spreadsheets I found someone who had problem with UP0104P VRM and was looking for replacement for his Radeon 7870.

Your GPU and memory resistance looks to be in the range of normal.  The 2-3 ohms on #2 is your problem.  That's basically a dead short to ground on the card's power supply.  The short could be in a number of different places, but the most likely are:

The PCB itself, in the vicinity of one of the high-side MOSFETs

The power MOSFETs on the Vcore rail (We know it's not the memory or controller rails because they're not shorted)

One of the capacitors on the 12V rail



The PCB itself seems to be the most common culprit, in my experience.  If this is the case, it's really not worth the effort trying to fix this card, because the PCB is the one component you can't replace.  There are a few ways of diagnosing of exactly which one it is, though.  The simplest is to supply a current through the board at the operating voltage and amperage, and look for components that get warm. If you find one, you remove it and then recheck your resistance.  Keep in mind, it's possible to have more than one failed component.  You you need a power supply that allows you to set both voltage and amperage limits, though - an ATX power supply won't work.



Another option is to just start removing the components that are connected to the 12V rail and hope you get lucky.  Experience tells me that this doesn't usually work, though.  Keep in mind that if you hot air a component off the board, and the board is still hot, most of your measured resistances will be lower than they would be at room temperature.  The GPU die will appear to be a dead short until it cools down."

			This isn't correct not even close. All DX12 cards support DXR. The difference lies in the implementation. Nvidia contributed no more to the API than AMD did.



What you can say though it's that Nvidia is the only one that ships hardware today that had DXR enabled. That's true. But more than that and you're getting into areas where it's just not accurate.

If you're just talking about Direct X 12 as it was released back in 2015, you are correct, but I was referring specifically to DX12 Ultimate, where the four new key features specifically require back-end hardware support that is only available at the moment on RTX Turing GPUs available since 2018. It's blatantly obvious at this point that Nvidia contributed more and for much longer to DX12 Ultimate seeing that it's their hardware that's being fully supported first and it's in their best interest to do so. Coincidence? I think not. Please don't ignore that MS and NV were the main collaborators in developing the DXR 1.0 API  in Windows that leverages RTX hardware and has actually been used in games that support it. Not saying that AMD didn't contribute anything to DX12 Ultimate but at best, AMD's contributions to new API stems more from their work with MS on the XBox One Series X which looks to me is still based on what RTX already has (RT Cores, Mesh shading, VRS, Sampler Feedback). Remember, AMD and Intel eventually had to announce their future support of raytracing in their roadmaps after RTX came out. Not before.








	
	
		
		
			That's why I've said multiple times that's it's really disingenuous to say Nvidia developed  Ray tracing in games it's not true at all. Imagination has done more to put tray tracing in games than even Nvidia.

I didn't say what you think I said because I was clearly talking about the DX12 Ultimate API which is based on RTX Turing hardware capabilities, not ""who invented ray tracing in games"". It's Nvidia's own Hardware-Accelerated Real-Time Hybrid Ray Tracing for PC games along with Mesh Shading and Variable Rate Shading that were adopted in Direct X 12 Ultimate as the basic underlying hardware feature set design and those were evidently established on the RTX Turing feature set back in 2018. Surely it wasn't just a coincidence to have Turing to support four out of four DX12 Ultimate features on the outset? AMD and Intel will have to release similar hardware implementations that support these newly announced DX12 features in due time."

Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X will have these features and over time developers will concentrate less and less on devices without it.

It happened few times already. At first games became pretty ugly on older hardware, much uglier than games designed for this older hardware and broken at times. Then older hardware stopped being supported altogether. Straight console ports usually require all the features console had or they do not run.

Navi 5600XT is newer than RTX 2060 but mentally it is as new as Radeon 7xxx cards are. When was it... 8 years ago  



Right now consoles are not even released yet and it might take some time before not having their features become an issue but when it does then resell value of card that cannot run all software will be terrible. So even assuming you really are not interested in any of these features and choose AMD card because it is slightly cheaper then I just do not see the point and that is my main point.



Used RTX card like 2060 will hold price much better. Not only because Nvidia cards usually do but exactly because of the fact they support required APIs which will make them much more interesting purchase, especially for developers who will want to learn programming ray tracing and such and do not really need great performance but still hardware with all features for testing their code."

No idea if AMD Navi cards are better or worst but I would suspect memory bandwidth and latency besides compute performance will count. Just not much data in that respects, maybe you know more. Working on super high res 360 type files then a Vega FE would probably work extremely well. With Vega FE and AMD pro cards that can use the Pro drivers, you can also use increase the memory footprint of the GPU, for like the Vega FE to 32gb using the high bandwidth cache controller. Just some stuff to think about. the Used market with very effective cards could also be on your list. Once again the 5600 with 6gb of ram, 192bit?  lower bandwidth, less compute units makes less sense then a Radeon 5700 256bit bus, 8gb of ram not even considering gaming performance for compute tasks. Then again AMD Vega cards are very powerful for many professional applications plus really versatile with GPU memory configuration. AMD pro drivers are actually really stable, kinda suck for gaming, you might want to check pro cards out as well.



Found some photoshop benchmarks and once again the Vega 64 does extremely well, Radeon Pro Vega 64 which is a Mac 16gb version (basically a Vega FE) is right up there with the 2080 Ti's

https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchm...pplication=Photoshop&specs=Vega#results-table



2080 Ti results

https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchm...ication=Photoshop&specs=2080+Ti#results-table



Safe to say lower end cards will perform worst, ram bandwidth/speed, number of shaders, memory capacity looks to be key.

		Click to expand...
	
If you're hitting upper 60s/70s I'd say it's definitely worth it even if you aren't OCing. The only issue is if you mind voiding the warranty. I wouldn't mess with liquid metal or any conductive TIM. Good old AS5 is working fine on mine.



One thing you can do that would help without needing to remove the warranty sticker is place some thermal pads in the spots on the underside of the backplate.

			Personally I never felt I got a whole ton out of overclocking the video cards, the cpu on the other hand I usually noticed the difference but rarely did pushing the video card really net me a better experience. Benchmarking is really the only time I have pushed it just to see the theoretical max of the system and my 1080 can hit 2.1 GHz and sustain it. Most of the time tho it's running at it's default and it plays just fine. Think I get more of a kick out of tweaking the system just to see what I can get it to do.
		
		Click to expand...
	
I've found GPU overclocking to be useful when you are looking for a few more guaranteed FPS in a given game. For example, if you're aiming for a consistent 100FPS but averaging 97, upping the GPU core and/or memory can gain you those last few frames. If your FPS is wildly fluctuating then GPU OCing won't be able to make up the difference."

			right now the 5700 non x is probably the best price/performance card in the last 4 years.  If you're into overclocking, and either want to put it under water, or just crank up the fan, you can easily powerplay table mod them for a significant boost in performance, in many cases higher than the 5700xt stock.  It really comes down to the silicon, cooling, and type of stock or custom power delivery layout you get from the vendor.  Most people try the powerplay table mod for a day or two and then just settle in on something slightly under max volts and clocks to get that comfy heat/performance balance under 80c for extended gaming.  While it won't give you 4k60 in the newest games, it will deliver an experience comparable to what you're going to get from the ps5/nextbox.  I just upgraded the media box in my living room from a 970 gtx to a 5700xt and honestly it has way outperformed my expectations from a sub $400 card.  When you find games like Doom Eternal that have been designed to take advantage of AMD hardware, it's quite a remarkable little card.  The real factor for most gamers today is do you want 4k60 or do you prefer hi fps at 1080/1440.  If you need 4k60, Nvidia knows that they hold the trump card right now in that class and decidedly charge a significant premium for it.  While a 2080 super has made it more approachable, the custom 2080ti cards have really distanced themselves from the pack in the last year or so. 



On a side note, what games would you be playing?  Often times most gamers really only pump their time into 2-3 main titles a year and then maybe a few ancillary pleasures.  That should really be the deciding factor in the type of card you're looking for.

I decided to buy a RX550 for now, the drivers of the 8500GT are all over the place. I will be playing some light stuff at 1080p for now. THe idea of having Big Navi is to run 1440p at high framerates (I know it's going to be a 4k capable card), by that time i'll have my 1440p @144Hz monitor around, and then, enjoy gaming for some years without worrying if something is going to run fine or not.

As i'm getting older I have less and less time for gaming, so all of this is mostly a hobby, but when I play, i like to play with very few compromises.

The iddea of the RX550 is to keep it as a backup card, if this situation shows up again... or maybe to have it in another setup to put it to good use."

			Thank you

Right now I have the RTX 2080 ti, I do play 95 % flight simulators at 4k.

Main reason I'd go for AMD? Try not to laugh :

dithering.

I have some color banding, and I can't find a way to fix this

It's pretty annoying especially when I fly very close to the clouds

Last year I purchased the AMD Radeon VII and I didn't really give it a good test

Sent it back because of the poor performance

I did fly X-Plane 11 at that time ( now, too ) but meanwhile, X-Plane 11 updated to Vulkan and a lot of users, even the developers, encourage to buy AMD cards

Second flight simulator I play is DCS World

And 2, 3 others but the next one, which comes later this year, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 would be the greatest, and I have absolutely no idea about which GPU would be the best choice : AMD or nVidia

When I tested the AMD Radeon VII, last year, with X-Plane 11, I was a bit disappointed about the performance but I was really surprised that the color banding disappeared 90 %

The clouds and skies were looking amazing

That's the reason why I asked about AMD

I own right now, 4 different 4k TV's

1 Samsung Q9FN 55 inches - amazing TV. Maybe the best Samsung TV, in the history of the TV's    

1 Samsung Q90R 55 inches - amazing TV, as well. Very hard to compare it with Q9FN

1 Samsung JS 9090 55 inches - older model but it's not bad

and the TV in the living room, Panasonic 75 inches,I'm not sure about the model - didn't really use it as PC monitor. Just some short testing

It's hard to believe, all of them has color banding

I even tried with more than 10 different nVidia drivers

No go.

I also tried with :

1 RTX Asus Strix 2080 Ti

1 RTX MSI Trio 2080 Ti

1 GTX Gigabyte 1080 Ti

1 GTX Gigabyte 980 Ti

Changed 4-5 different HDMI 2.0 cables

Installed Windows 10, fresh

Played with many different settings in nVidia control panel, TV settings.

Hundreds of different types of settings

Couldn't find a solution

I was even thinking about installing Windows 7 on the Z390 chipset. It's possible but it requires a lot time, PS 2 mouse and keyboard for the installation, PCI e card with PS2, etc

Thank you, I'll keep searching for the best solution

After all this, I came to the conclusion that the main culprit for the color banding, is the nVidia software

The problem is you have no control over how the sim is coded, one cannot use a vidoegame as a calibration reference.  Your visual fidelity is only as a good as the source.  I recommend getting a colorimeter such as a Spyder and calibrate your monitor.  Second the quality of 4K and 8K varies depending on source.  Use my link to the video below to look for banding, the Red system is well over 100K with the lenses."

Been gaming with both settings using different games the past week with both profiles and have yet to have a crash yet..



UV Settings: 1810 core/1200 memory 970mV Power limit 20%

I made no such assertion. I just said the framework for the hardware implementation of DXR as well as VRS and Mesh Shading is very much based on Microsoft and Nvidia's work on them which naturally is based on the hardware capabilities that Nvidia has done with Turing. I never implied that Nvidia directly shared any proprietary technology with AMD. The DXR 1.0 API spec was developed by MS and NV after which MS used the resulting requirements in separately developing the custom GPU in the Xbox One Series X with AMD.

I totally agree, but my point is, it's a win-win for AMD, MS and Nvidia. AMD gets hybrid RTRT sooner than later, Nvidia gets broader developer support for their technologies especially RTX, thus their cards stay relevant in the midst of the AMD-powered next-gen consoles, and MS achieves a more unified platform in the Xbox and Windows gaming PCs.

The outgoing AMD exec nearly confirmed as much. That Vega on 7nm was never meant for gaming and the Mi50 laser job was all that was needed to hold off their competitor at the high end. Navi is here and once the drivers get sorted, the 5700 Series will get better and better than the Radeon VII in newer/modern game titles. So it makes sense that the Radeon VII is going EOL soon. That also means that big-navi is on it's way, rumored to be 5 months behind 5700 series release.



I think the Navi on AIO cooling is going to kick the $699 Radeon 7's azz. And that is why we have not seen any AIO Navi reviews yet, because AMD is trying to let down those R7 buyers softly.

1.  12V input across your new fuse.  0 ohms is good here, but I suspect you'll see an open circuit.

2.  12V input to ground - You're looking for a big-ish number here.  Most AMD cards I've looked at show a few thousand.

3.  GPU VCore - You should see a low number here - something like 10 ohms.

4.  Memory - The memory itself has its own power separate from the controller.  You're looking for like 50-200 ohms here.

5.  Memory Controller - Of the five VRM phases in the row there by display connectors, it looks like the one furthest from the PCI-E slot connector is the memory controller.  40-100 ohms is sane here.

6.  3.3V - You're looking for about 350 ohms here, as I recall. The exact value doesn't matter to us for now, as long as it's not zero.

7. Minor rails - These little 8 pin ICs are often controllers for smaller VRMs that produce various other voltages that the card needs to function.  I can't read the part numbers on them, so I can't tell you for sure which pins are the outputs, but it's usually pins 7 and 8.  At least one of them is a BIOS ROM chip (looks like U10).  We'll assume they're not the issue for now, but you'd be looking for a few thousand ohms on each one if you can figure out which pins are the outputs.

8.  5V minor VRMs - a couple thousand ohms.



Take those measurements and report back.  Do not attempt to run the card again until you figure out why the original fuse failed.  You risk further damage, if you do.  I can't promise I've properly identified all the rails, since I'm just looking at photos, but you should be able to get in the ballpark this way.



In your second two photos, the first looks like a glob of flux residue, but could also be a scorch mark on the board, indicating a short in that area - hard to say from the photo.  The one with the fan connector just looks like corrosion, but it's hard to say.  Can you post some more photos of that area of the board, from both sides?  Was this card used when it came to you?"

My fault. By saying ""not a laboratory one"" I put my thoughts without explanation that I don't have money for a power supply like this. Even cheap ones are expensive.

But as they say - Necessity is the mother of invention. You said ATX power supply won't suffice. BUT I've found a great step-down module based on XL4016 chip. It can be driven by ATX power supply. It can do up to 8A easily. 1,5-32V no problem. Very good efficiency and on top of all of that it doesn't cost $100, but $15 - for a better circuit with Voltage and Amperage reading and ability to set them both. Too good to be true?

I own FW900 and to me this monitor is not second coming of Christ like some people suggest it is.

SMPTE-C phosphors used in this monitor are actually pretty meh when compared with eg. typical European TVs and many much cheaper VGA CRTs. Better darker phosphors eg. EBU give gamut that is very close to sRGB and better contrast ratio with less dependence on ambient lighting and with less flaring and inner glass reflections and also less phosphor trails.



Only saving grace and reason for FW900 popularity is its rather big size and wide screen aspect ratio. It is however not really any reference how picture quality of CRT should look like."

All Global Illumination implementations are costly, that is why most games do not have it already.

Yes, it will bottleneck it in the sense that you would achieve higher FPS with a faster CPU, especially in a game like CSGO which can hit north of 300fps.

AMD's 5**** series has been a much better price/performance than Nvidia, since launch day last summer. 5600XT is a little closer in price. But, it is still priced better.



Of course, we all want GPUs to be even cheaper. But, AMD is definitely driving prices downward.

Just that you can get right now on Newegg different 5700's for $329, put a 5700XT bios on it and OC it to much higher levels then any 5600. It also has 2gb more memory, more memory bandwidth which for NAVI is needed. All for $30 - $40 more and cheaper than some of the 5600 ASUS ones. I don't see the price of the 5600 as good, $249 starting price would have made much more sense with special AIB cards being less than $300. Also 5700 have gone below $300 at times on sell.

			Your GPU and memory resistance looks to be in the range of normal.  The 2-3 ohms on #2 is your problem.  That's basically a dead short to ground on the card's power supply.  The short could be in a number of different places, but the most likely are:

The PCB itself, in the vicinity of one of the high-side MOSFETs

The power MOSFETs on the Vcore rail (We know it's not the memory or controller rails because they're not shorted)

One of the capacitors on the 12V rail



The PCB itself seems to be the most common culprit, in my experience.  If this is the case, it's really not worth the effort trying to fix this card, because the PCB is the one component you can't replace.  There are a few ways of diagnosing of exactly which one it is, though.  The simplest is to supply a current through the board at the operating voltage and amperage, and look for components that get warm. If you find one, you remove it and then recheck your resistance.  Keep in mind, it's possible to have more than one failed component.  You you need a power supply that allows you to set both voltage and amperage limits, though - an ATX power supply won't work.



Another option is to just start removing the components that are connected to the 12V rail and hope you get lucky.  Experience tells me that this doesn't usually work, though.  Keep in mind that if you hot air a component off the board, and the board is still hot, most of your measured resistances will be lower than they would be at room temperature.  The GPU die will appear to be a dead short until it cools down.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Removing components on the 12V rail to find a failing one doesn't sound like fun. So I would need some proper power supply to look for hot components and then hot air solder to replace them. I was thinking about power supply and hot air for some time now. I will need to look on the Internet if there's some power supply (probably not a laboratory one) + hot-air that I can afford. But it can end up with a dead-end as I could not afford two of those things at once."

Since Nvidia has higher prices there was no need for AMD to constrain the AIB partners profits which help support AMD in the end anyways. It is not just AMD but partners as well that are looking for a profit. As for the 5600XT, that would be a very hard sell to me, I would get the 5700 on sell, 8gb ram, 256bit bus, OC's very good while the 5600XT looks like it does not have much left after the bios update."

			Q: Lisa, can you give us some idea of what new GPUs you're expected to launch to the rest of 2020, for PCs and for data center?



LS: Yes. In 2019, we launched our new architecture in GPUs, it's the RDNA architecture, and that was the Navi based products. You should expect that those will be refreshed in 2020 - and we'll have a next generation RDNA architecture that will be part of our 2020 lineup. So we're pretty excited about that, and we'll talk more about that at our financial analyst day. On the data center GPU side, you should also expect that we'll have some new products in the second half of this year.
		
		Click to expand...
	
So next gen RNDA will be talked about (revealed?) March 5. It is clear that data center new GPU's in 2nd half which to me infers gaming next Gen RNDA in 1st half with a refresh for 1st Gen products sometime in 2020. Is this not about the same time as Nvidia will reveal their Ampere cards? AMD launching first I am thinking, leading maybe for the first time the next generation in a long period of time."

If you're into overclocking, and either want to put it under water, or just crank up the fan, you can easily powerplay table mod them for a significant boost in performance, in many cases higher than the 5700xt stock.  It really comes down to the silicon, cooling, and type of stock or custom power delivery layout you get from the vendor.  Most people try the powerplay table mod for a day or two and then just settle in on something slightly under max volts and clocks to get that comfy heat/performance balance under 80c for extended gaming.  While it won't give you 4k60 in the newest games, it will deliver an experience comparable to what you're going to get from the ps5/nextbox.  I just upgraded the media box in my living room from a 970 gtx to a 5700xt and honestly it has way outperformed my expectations from a sub $400 card.  When you find games like Doom Eternal that have been designed to take advantage of AMD hardware, it's quite a remarkable little card.  The real factor for most gamers today is do you want 4k60 or do you prefer hi fps at 1080/1440.  If you need 4k60, Nvidia knows that they hold the trump card right now in that class and decidedly charge a significant premium for it.  While a 2080 super has made it more approachable, the custom 2080ti cards have really distanced themselves from the pack in the last year or so.  



On a side note, what games would you be playing?  Often times most gamers really only pump their time into 2-3 main titles a year and then maybe a few ancillary pleasures.  That should really be the deciding factor in the type of card you're looking for."

Their workstation drivers has no OCing ability and prevents utilities from also OCing them combined with very poor gaming support/performance. Nvidia ProDrivers are just miles ahead for gaming while supporting Pro Software stacks plus the huge Cuda eco-system as well as AI.



Some folks forget that AMD has had some of the best cooling cards out there. Like the Vega 64 LC which easily cooled the card when consuming over 400w of power and is relatively quiet, frankly I got up to almost 500w supplied to my Vega 64 LC and the cooler was able to keep up. So having a greater than 300w card, maybe with a bios switch position, is not out of the realm of what AMD can do again, if it can benefit a use case, hopefully more viable than Vega 64 LC where yes it did perform better but was utterly restricted by the memory bandwidth.



As for AMD pricing, it will have to be very tempting to release early and price high as possible. A 80Cu HBM2e configurations 16gb/32gb, their top model which would also go into professional cards, smashing Nvidia current solutions by miles may be a $3000 plus card. Which for the hardware maybe OK but on the software end it may just be rejected at that price unless purely a specialized type usage. Nvidia won the Big Red Supercomputer bid for Indiana University while AMD won the CPU side (meaning AMD did not have a better solution on the GPU side). It maybe more prudent for AMD to make their 40%-45% profit, sell them much lower than the competition to get back in that segment at a very fast rate, work on software and developers supporting. All conjecture and critical thinking. We don't know what AMD has and how high the stack will go. It could be a high end 60Cu part first with a 52Cu part all using DDR6, 384bit/320bit bus. Even those should perform well. Does AMD make one bigger chip and have many smaller CU skews? Or have a Pro GPU plus a Gaming GPU versions?



It has been said/rumored that AMD has a GPU with both HBM and DDR6 memory controller built in -> if so that would to me indicate a die that can be used in more configurations/skews, lower yielding complete dies or bigger dies could be viable if they are still functional. Navi goal was to be scalable with next gen memory support, so having fewer design dies that can be used in multiple ways would be very interesting and could give an advantage on usable yields, simplify manufacturing and board designs.



We just have to wait to see what really is going to be available, performance, worth. Could be another let down moment as well."

Nvidia has been an order of magnitude greater than AMD in their architecture efficiency, It's going to be hard to use AMD for datacenter type setups when the power envelope difference is so vast.  Also AI is becoming closer to a necesity for everything moving ahead, and as far as I know, there's only like 4 companies doing (their own) legit tensor cores at scale right now.  Nvidia, Google, Tesla, and Marvell.  Marvell is looking to consolidate the market for custom Tensor silicon designs (which they then bang out on GloFo),  They have been buying up all the competing engineers and slowly axing the competition, so at some point, you're going to start hearing their name a lot more, kinda like when google arrived."

Sure, there were instances where there were some issues but it is not like Nvidia had clean record either and most of the issues with drivers people have had were not even on AMD GPUs but originate from ATI Radeon HD2xxx and HD3xxx and partially HD4xxx but at this point they improved drivers a lot. All GCN based GPUs had pretty good drivers and AMD definitely did great job at keeping drivers up to date even for older cards.



That said currently AMD have no GPU that I could recommend because none of their cards support DirectX 12 Ultimate, there is no alternative to DLSS and no alternative to Nvenc.

DirectX 12 Ultimate have the same features as upcoming next gen consoles. RTX cards already have full support.

People complain about DXR performance on RTX 2xxx cards but actually even with lowly RTX 2060 at 1080p you can play most games at around 60fps just fine. There is also quite a lot of games supporting it and more are to come.

New DX12 also have something called Variable Rate Shading which can increase framerates and most if not all games released also for next games will utilize.

RTX cards also have DLSS which can increase framerate by quite a lot. With DLSS 2.0 you get near native quality.



I also suspect that resell value of RTX cards will be higher than Navi.

When Geforce 6800 launched with SM 3.0 and Radeon x800 still had SM 2.0 people who recommended ATI cards were saying the same things that these new fancy features are not important and little to no game uses it and if it does it does nothing worthwhile. Some time passed, new consoles used SM 3.0 hardware and some games started to be SM 3.0. What do you think this did to resell values of SM 2.0 cards?

Given both next generation consoles will have ray-tracing it might so happen that some PC ports of console games will either have eg. terrible or no proper lighting or won't run without DXR at all. It actually takes a lot of effort to create nice looking lighting in games and many modern games use techniques which won't make any sense to when developing for RT capable game. It might be not worth for game developers to spend money on old hardware on PC platform which is already minority when it comes to game sales.



Price difference between 5600XT and 2060 is not worth getting already obsolete hardware."

			Probably reaching power limit (think 330w for vega64, but should be same since it's probably a total PCIE (motherboard + cables) limit).  Should be able to keep OCs low on one side (GPU vs Mem) to help the other side stay stable or OC more (ie. 2050/1000 or 1900/1050).  I generally play within my Freesync monitor VRR range so put more OC to GPU clocks to help min FPS as I believe higher mem clock generally just helps max FPS.

You are incorrect in the thinking that the memory clock just improves max FPS, especially with the VEGA family.  The difference in both charts and ""smoothness"" is insane when taking a VEGA from 800/945mhz HBM to 1100Mhz+...



cybereality , you are correct that this is a much better experience then VEGA Crossfire.  I am having an issue with my AMD card...I put it into an old Athlon X4 945 platform I keep around for testing..I wanted to burn the card in OC'd for 24hrs before I took it apart and attempted the Ghetto WC'ing...I installed Windows 10 Pro, and everything was fine (I was using an RX 550 at the time)...Windows asked to reboot, and it would just black screen...



I installed the Radeon vII, system posts fine, but when it goes to boot Windows, just instant black screen again...I never see the loading windows icon etc...I was in bed with a severe migraine for the last 27 hours so I did not have time to mess with it yesterday..I need to make sure these cards are good before I tear my primary loop down."

Both have driver issues, that is why new drivers are coming out all the time. For any consolation, I am having no major issues with my 5700 XT, issues yes but nothing remotely detrimental for me. I have issues with Nvidia drivers too, nothing too serious. I've seen flips over and over again on who had major issues.

I have come to realize through stress tests of all hardware for stability, through combinations of windows updates and amd drivers, that it is simply this: Windows updates are bad or AMD drivers are bad or both are bad but one is weaker than the other. I am happy with my AMD hardware but pissed about its stability via software. Why, because it's not real stable compared to the competition across the board, it's just not. AMD is beating brand new intel chips in terms of value and overall performance(not gaming) and yet they are pushing a new chip series out and their software is not mature. Ive been a builder for almost 20 years, my first system was amd and an ati 9800 pro. I am not loyal to companies, there has been no reason to buy AMD for over a decade. I have never had the intermittent issues with intel/nvidia that I have had with these two Ryzen/5700xt builds. And that is the key right there ""intermittent"" I keep having to uninstall/reinstall updates/drivers and mismatch them just so I can watch a damned youtube video without a restart.

			Unbelievable to me.  And disappointing to be sure. Sentiments coming from a tremendous Fury X crossfire fan who had a stellar experience with the crossfire tech.  I'm still looking for a limited edition, watercooled version to purchase.  I purchased a limited edition XFX black Vega, but I'm not opening it in hopes of a watercooled card.



A friend sent me this vid yesterday.  At least we can purchase these cards with our eyes wide open at this point.  Two key takeaways from the video.   Rise of the Tomb Raider felt smoother on Vega than 1080ti - even running 20fps less.



And the overclock profile uses nearly 100 watts more for a measly 2% more FPS.  He said AMD shouldn't even have created a setting like that.

Hopefully I manage to get the plain jane Vega64 today if stock is true at the store near me today. I put a pre-order for the liquid the other day and doesn't look like it will be filled anytime soon. So I will cancel it and just get an EK wb if I manage to scoop one today. I am a little salty with the pricing where I live enough that I seriously thought about going green with a 1080ti and a gsync monitor. However, owning a freesync ultrawide monitor already I'm in with the red eco system. To replace with a Gsync ultrawide is probably more cost prohibitive.



I took a chance on pair of R9 290 cards when they first came out even though everyone bitched about how power and heat where through the roof and kept telling me I should have bought a 780ti instead. I just used waterblocks to ease that pain and for almost 4 years they have served me well especially when I was able to flash them to a 290X easily. I certainly hope Vega can repeat at least 3 of those years. I'm not waiting on Navi, but it doesn't mean I will be intrigued about it. And for fuck sakes AMD, keep it quiet this time. No more fucking hype train shit.



I think the worst product I bought on launch day was the HD5970. You think no xfire support with Vega at the moment is bad. Try to imagine to purchase an expensive dual GPU card where day one you couldn't use xfire at all. I think there was a beta driver that allowed only a select few games that could work with it. Beyond that you were screwed for a month or two.

Maybe Nvidia was willing to let this happen just to make sure their R&D and transistor/die space investments in Turing (RTX, Mesh Shaders, VRS) gets wide spread adoption so these technologies stay relevant as baseline features for the next gen consoles and GPUs from AMD and Intel to have similar implementations via common API specs/requirements as they were introduced in Turing instead of having those features fade into irrelevance like some of Nvidia's other technological investments (PhysX, Simultaneous Multi-Projection, etc.). With DX12 Ultimate and Vulkan Ray Tracing, Nvidia has pretty much had a major hand in defining how hybrid real-time ray tracing is done in the industry. According to the Digital Foundry videos featuring the XBox Series X, AMD's RDNA2 will also have their own ""RT cores"" to handle BVH in hardware. I do wonder how de-noising will be handled by each vendor going forward. Turing can possibly use their tensor cores while RDNA2 might be able to do them using shaders."

For some moments I will really regret not buying the 5700XT, but when Big Navi launches I certainly will think that it worth the wait, also, i'm going to have better FPS in 1440p for sure. I think it's time for me to play all of the Jedi Knight series"

Still I would recommend a 5700 over this card, it would beat the 2060 KO in way more games in performance, 2gb more memory, increase memory bandwidth, bios upgradable to virtually 5700 XT performance etc. Just have to live with any quarks with the drivers.

			Nvidia has been an order of magnitude greater than AMD in their architecture efficiency, It's going to be hard to use AMD for datacenter type setups when the power envelope difference is so vast.  Also AI is becoming closer to a necesity for everything moving ahead, and as far as I know, there's only like 4 companies doing (their own) legit tensor cores at scale right now.  Nvidia, Google, Tesla, and Marvell.  Marvell is looking to consolidate the market for custom Tensor silicon designs (which they then bang out on GloFo),  They have been buying up all the competing engineers and slowly axing the competition, so at some point, you're going to start hearing their name a lot more, kinda like when google arrived.

We do not know what AMD will have with Arcturus architecture efficiency or Nvidia next gen Tesla GPU's. We do know that Nvidia has sound and highly used software stack that support their hardware which AMD does not seem to have. Only way I see AMD competing with Nvidia is to sell much lower to allow college students, engineers, scientist etc. a very affordable potent card to use to get their development and user numbers up. This would not be overnight. Nvidia also has AI servers that one can rent for deep learning so one does not even need to invest heavily into a rig.



AMD, my opinion, maybe needs to think very big/wide/long term here for data servers. Hire some professional teachers/programmers/video producers and give out a lot of training to ease those professionals into using AMD eco-system. Like Apple virtually owning desktop publishing for years even where their hardware was second rate compared to the PC side, video - once folks get use to an eco-system and able to perform tasks and get the job done -> it becomes really hard to now retrain, convince, buy new software etc. to go to something else. AMD getting into separate unique markets like video editing etc. other fields requiring very high FP64 etc. would be prudent while also building up in markets already established."

			Just so we're clear, you have maybe a 25% chance of success here, under reasonably favorable circumstances.  I don't mean that to sound condescending, but it's just that this mode of failure usually seems to be the result of a short through the PCB itself, which is frustratingly difficult to diagnose, and nearly impossible to repair in any way that leaves the card actually usable, even if you get it ""working.""



Now...  You need to take some resistance measurements between a few spots on the board.  I strongly suspect that your new fuse is now blown as well, which suggests that you haven't cleared the short.



I've marked up your photos to indicate where you need to take the measurements.  Results of this test will tell us which circuit on the board is actually subject to the short.



View attachment 223360View attachment 223361



1.  12V input across your new fuse.  0 ohms is good here, but I suspect you'll see an open circuit.

2.  12V input to ground - You're looking for a big-ish number here.  Most AMD cards I've looked at show a few thousand.

3.  GPU VCore - You should see a low number here - something like 10 ohms.

4.  Memory - The memory itself has its own power separate from the controller.  You're looking for like 50-200 ohms here.

5.  Memory Controller - Of the five VRM phases in the row there by display connectors, it looks like the one furthest from the PCI-E slot connector is the memory controller.  40-100 ohms is sane here.

6.  3.3V - You're looking for about 350 ohms here, as I recall. The exact value doesn't matter to us for now, as long as it's not zero.

7. Minor rails - These little 8 pin ICs are often controllers for smaller VRMs that produce various other voltages that the card needs to function.  I can't read the part numbers on them, so I can't tell you for sure which pins are the outputs, but it's usually pins 7 and 8.  At least one of them is a BIOS ROM chip (looks like U10).  We'll assume they're not the issue for now, but you'd be looking for a few thousand ohms on each one if you can figure out which pins are the outputs.

8.  5V minor VRMs - a couple thousand ohms.



Take those measurements and report back.  Do not attempt to run the card again until you figure out why the original fuse failed.  You risk further damage, if you do.  I can't promise I've properly identified all the rails, since I'm just looking at photos, but you should be able to get in the ballpark this way.



In your second two photos, the first looks like a glob of flux residue, but could also be a scorch mark on the board, indicating a short in that area - hard to say from the photo.  The one with the fan connector just looks like corrosion, but it's hard to say.  Can you post some more photos of that area of the board, from both sides?  Was this card used when it came to you?

That's very helpful! I've read your thread about resurrecting dead GPUs and it is really great, with a lot of useful information! I finally start to understand what's going on.

Because it's late in here, I'm going to get some rest and make measurements tomorrow.

You're right about the new fuse - it's dead too. It was a good fuse so I hope it did its job and protected the circuit. I'm not expecting to fix this card but I want to try it anyway, because as I said - I love to learn and because of this failed GPU I already learned a lot, and there's more. Much more 

I got the card as brand new. No one used it before me. The air in here is dry/very dry, though I can't  ensure that this card didn't get a drop of water while doing something with / next to the PC. Though it's not likely.

I don't have any more photos because I cleaned these spots with alcohol and they look brand new now. These are the only (old) pics I got.

			Nice, sounds like a decent card despite all the complaints against it. I know we say this all the time, but, I think it will improve over the next few driver revisions. Once they get those early teething issues sorted it will move from been a decent card to a great card. Once the stock improves prices should improve too. $649 would make this card a really good buy.

Latest leaks / info is saying that they are including hardware DXR but only because everything is pretty much going to need it moving ahead.  Unfortunately they also acknowledged that it's pretty much just a gimmick right now due to the massive performance hit for the tiny image upgade that is currently available.  If that's the case there is no way this console life cycle is going to have enough hardware raytracing to deliver that wow factor people are looking for, the way ray tracing was intended to just solve every problem.  We'll continue to see it a little bit in some reflections and such that don't have quite as much of a performance penalty.  By the time the next Gen of consoles is ready (if we haven't figured out game streaming by then), the ps6 will hit the ground running with full scene ray tracing from hardware to software.  Until then, honestly it's just a gimmick, so I wouldn't make any buying decisions based on it until it is close to or on par with current gpu performance.



DLSS however, with the exponential rise in AI processing power, will get better, and eventually acheive parity with native image quality.  That would be a massive cou for Nvidia considering the uptick we see in performance.  By the time full scene ray tracing is ready for prime time, it might just be the difference between 30 fps at 4k on RTG and 60 fps at 4k on Nvidia."

Only problem I see is that AMD current precedent with NAVI is slightly lower cost but better performance. If AMD has a 2080Ti competitive part and better performance, no current competition coming -> does not look like AMD will be selling way cheaper, more like $100 maybe. Unless they market it to compete with whatever the RTX 3080 will be presuming around 2080Ti performance at $899. Then yes that would be very cool, a great introduction into the very high end, then again AMD may have a very special higher end card like with HBM etc. to compete with the Titan Ampere and sell it over $1000 like $1399 or something. If that is the case I hope it is not another FE driver limited nightmare card but a card where you decide if you want the Pro drivers or gaming drivers and both are well supported. Hell Nvidia does such a great job on their pro drivers that they run games virtually as fast as their gaming drivers to begin with.

EDIT:

From what I've learned trying to get more information about how to repair a GPU, looks like failing MOSFETs is the second most common problem after failing capacitor (at least it looks that it's like this).

I'll try to check MOSFETs on my card once I get more time to do so. Anyway I've seen people desoldering mosfets and running their cards ""just fine"".

Short answer is probably not, for a couple of reasons.



First, many of the GCN designs have a voltage controller that is smart enough to tell that one phase isn't running at all.  Exactly what it does when this happens, I don't know, but there's a decent chance that it will just not work at all.  At best, it's problematic.



Second, with only four phases, you're down 25% of your power supply to the core.  If you don't do a lot of compute heavy tasks with this card, you may get away with it, but it sort of defeats the purpose of having a powerful GPU if you can't use it, and you can obviously forget about overclocking."

GPU no more than 1050mv.  I'm between 1000 and 1050 depending on what I'm using the GPU for.

HBM can be set at 1000mv and still hit stock MHz.



And get rid of ASUS GPU Tweak and use AfterBurner or just use Glabal Wattman in Radeon Settings.  I just use Wattman as AfterBurner doesn't let me do/control some of the things I want to.





I have the Sapphire Nitro+ Vega 64 and my settings in Global Wattman:



Performance / Watt Profile set to Custom

GPU Frequency (MHz) set to Dymanic and at 1632 in State 7

Voltage Control (mv) set to Manual and 1000mV

Memory Frequency (MHz) set to Dymanic and at 1000 in State 3

Voltage Control (mv) set to Manual and 1000mV

Fan Speed RPM) set to Manual and 1750 min / 2750 Target

Temperature (C) Control set to Manual and 80 Max / 75 Target

Power Limit set to 20%



Setting to Dynamic allows the Card to self regulate based on temps and load.  You will most likely end up with higher MHz too than with stock volts as stock volts cause high HBM temps and high GPU Hot Spot temps."

			I have the equipment, though I'm not certain what's the best way to supply this card. Should I buy some PCI raiser and mod it to have ability to put in 12V in there? Or is there some equipment I couldn't find that I can plug in the GPU and test it?

I could always do it dirty way and solder + and - to the power supply 



When I'll get down to test the card. I suppose I should start with 12V and give it as little amperes as possible at the beginning. Have the circuit shorted with a fuse ""plugged in"" and give it some time to warm up. What's the good starting amount of Amperes? 500-1000 mA?
		
		Click to expand...
	
I think the best way to do this is to solder at least the positive lead directly to the card.  The pad for the fuse is a good place.  It's best to solder the ground as well, but you can use an alligator clip on the IO plate if you can't find a place to solder it to, keeping in mind that it needs to be a pretty big pad.  Don't be afraid to remove components from the card when you do this test and solder the leads to their pads.  The 12V caps are a good option, although if you use through-hole pads, putting the capacitor back becomes a pain if you can find and clear the short.  



You will likely also need some sort of indicating medium to actually tell where the short actually is.  You can use isopropanol for this, but obviously need to be careful because it's quite flammable.  The proper tool is refrigerant cold spray, but I actually think isopropanol works a little better.  When it works, this method makes the short pretty obvious, but I'd say that you have about a 75% chance of the short being in the board itself, and not a component.  If that's the case, you're going to do all this, and you will not obviously have a hot spot on the board.  If that happens, it's time to give up and use this card for parts to fix others."

Why would you hold your nose, it is only a video card. If a GTX or RTX serves you better that is what you should get. I would recommend a 2060 KO over a 5600 anyways. Performance difference would not be really noticeable. For DLSS supported games the 2060 KO will blow away the 5600.



With most recent 20.4.1 drivers my screen has been blanking out. Disabled AMD audio driver seems to have helped. Will have to give it time to see if that was the issue."

			Looks like the washer fix is only worth doing on the XT model and since I have the RX 5700, it is not worth it. GPU: 72C Edge temp: 82C VRam: 76C and these temps were all after running the Heaven benchmark in a loop for about 20 minutes, well the card was overclocked to 1830 speeds. Basically, if you are running an XT, it may be worth it but, if you are running an non XT, it is not worth the effort.



My card did not throttle, the fan was not noisy and everything ran just fine.

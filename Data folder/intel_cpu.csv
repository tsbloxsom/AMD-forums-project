			It's not hard. It's become so mainstream, the hardest part is making up your mind between all the options. Lol. Starting from scratch is expensive, but long term, if money is a concern as it is to me, most parts are transferable. Cpu blocks, pumps, radiators, reservoirs and fittings can be used build after build. I used the same pump for well over 10 years on my main pc.



Gpu blocks are the odd ball. If you are looking top end, it's pricey, and blocks often devalue cards.



You won't get significantly better clocks or temps on the cpu anymore though. A good aio is going to match it. The gpu though will love it, and silent gaming is quite wonderful.

I’m SO bad at projects like that. Need me to build a data center?  Done. Get rigid piping lined up?  Uh, why is the bathroom in pieces?  That’s what has me worried. And I’d go all out too 



I tend to go with high end AIB GPUs; silent storm idle, only run when gaming or transcoding, etc. and I do the same for case fans and the AIO; low power with a fast ramp. Is a bit annoying on my ryzen; they ramp a bit faster than I want, but it’s not bad."

			I'll post mine as well (maybe after I have a R9 290 installed). I have my L5639 OC'd to 3.6. Past that I was having issues with RAM clock stability. I'd still love to OC it to 4GHz at least but I'm extra cautious about doing that. No golden parachutes here when I make a mistake with the technology I own.

 

No games have taxed it much, so I'm very happy with having it.

 

By the way... does anyone have recommended OC settings for the ASUS Rampage III Formula with the L5639? I'd like to compare any tips with what I've got running.

			I don't agree with this at all. Frankly, I've tested lower end hardware and the statement is simply incorrect. At 1920x1080, you'd be able to make a fair case for some lower end hardware if your satisfied with medium settings in more modern games. That's just not how a lot of us roll here. This isn't oft|OCP. I've got a machine here with a Ryzen 7 2700X w/GTX 980 Ti and at 2560x1600, it's not able to maintain 144FPS (for 144Hz G-Sync) in Destiny 2 at maximum settings. Destiny 2 is actually fairly well optimized and runs very well given how good it looks. That machine can do 80-90FPS most of the time, even hitting 110FPS or so once in awhile but it does drop down to the 45-50FPS range quite often.



At 3440x1440 or 3840x2160, you simply need more power. I've got an RTX 2080 Super and an RTX 2080 Ti here and the latter is what I'd consider the bare minimum for a good 4K gaming experience. Even at 3440x1440, that would still generally be the case in a lot of games. At 1920x1080, the case for more powerful video cards comes down to higher frame rates for higher refresh rate monitors. These things all make a huge difference. At 1920x1080, the 2080 Super delivers a fantastic experience and can even push really high FPS. But crank up the settings and resolution and that 2080 Super starts to falter.



I've done the testing. I've reviewed lower end processors with higher end graphics cards and they do not get it done once you start cranking up the eye candy in more demanding games. It's the same thing with the video cards. For me, medium settings are a no go. I want maxed visuals at a minimum of 120FPS if I can get it. This cannot be achieved in more demanding games at decent resolution. For me, 1920x1080 is crap. Anything beyond a 24"" monitor and 1920x1080 looks absolutely terrible. An immersive experience demands a larger display as far as I'm concerned. That means higher resolution. Games are becoming increasingly multi-threaded. That means, there are good reasons to go beyond an i5 for gaming.

I'm well aware of how 'most people roll here'... i've been on/around this forum since probably 2004 or so... took a hiatus from caring about pc hardware for about 10 years and welp, here i am.

Anyways you said it in your last paragraph... I mentioned a few times that I'm not talking about max settings... and that everything I throw at my machine runs 'fine' at med-high settings. Clearly we have a divide in our opinions on what actually matters. If I can play the game and it looks alright, that's fine with me. I'm not looking at frame-rates or shadow quality or any of that. I've had $2500 builds, it's just not worth it to me anymore. I don't think you really read or understood what I was saying... of course there are good reasons to get high end stuff if you want the best gaming experience...



All I meant to say is that these days, things will run a lot smoother on just about anything you can buy new (hardware wise), a lot better than it used to in the past, in my opinion. If my dead grandmother's dell can run a new game without any lag... that's sayin' something"

			Yes, the ES chip can do 5.3 ghz all cores at around 1.310v-1.320v load or something.  But I'm having some weird issue where it seems (at least from a few quick tests) that using a cache ratio of x50 makes the system MORE stable than a cache ratio of x49!  I was getting CPU Cache L0 errors in Cinebench R20 at x53/x49 at 1.305v load.  ES CPU bug?  Or am I just cursed?  idk...Maybe everything's going to hell because the load temps are above 90C...and we don't talk about fight club when your load temps are above 90C!  But when I set cache to x50...it was stable? What...



My retail chip seems to need absurd volts for 5.3 all cores (like 1.4v at full load), but the 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 5 ghz voltages seem to be exactly the same load voltage requirement as my ES.

basically, the retail chip falls off at 5.2 ghz, and falls off HARD at 5.3 ghz.

			Not really, from my reading there are more excited about the 3300x than Intel's next chip.  It's expensive, burns power like crazy, and still falls short on many things.  Yes, it can give you a few more FPS at low resolutions, if that's your thing sure.

Over 90C with liquid cooling.. at 4.8ghz

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tw...at-over-90c-even-with-liquid-cooling/amp.html

And others saying similar

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tomshardware.com/amp/news/intel-core-i9-10900k-stress-test



So unless you spend some serious coin on the cooling good luck maintaining boost.  It just doesn't have a lot going for it.  Still gets beat by 3900x in threaded loads, still slightly out in front in low resolution gaming, use a crap ton of power to do it.  Just isn't a ton to get a excited about.  Hopefully we will see some real benchmarks but I haven't seen to much reason to be hopeful.



Edit.  You said your struggling to maintain 4.8... so does this chip with a 240mm radiator at over 90C.  Unless you're really hitting a wall in something specific, your not missing much.

			Hi, I just build my system with Intel 10900k. Coupled with Asus STRIX Z490 E and Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB 3600. Cpu cooler is Corsair h150i 360 mm.

Ive installed everything, the system is working. I have a score of 6025 in Cinebench 20.

But I have a problem.

With Open Hardware Monitor and CPU-Z, I see the cpu goes up to 4900mhz in all cores, which is totally fine. I see some random cores go to up to 5.1, when my computer is started.

My temps are around 34C on idle and 72C in benchmarking.

I never see 5.3 as advised on Intel. No mater what option I change, I never reach 5.3. My temps are ok, so its not about that. I wonder if I'm missing some configuration on the BIOS. I have multi core enhancement to auto, pretty much everything in auto, like turbo boos, and avx.

I understand this feature should work by itself without messing around with bios settings.

Have anyone had the same problem?

Thanks

UPDATE:



It wasn't the C-STATE. The was just a combination of factors that made me believe it was that.



The problem is Corsair iCUE software.



With everything on default, excepto for XMP Profile I was able to find the issue. When the Corsair software is running, it uses 5% of cpu, that make believe Windows that the cpu is not in lazy mode, as soon as you exit the soft, PUM, everything works.



I was reading on the net, it does the same on 9900k, but as far as I found, not on all motherboards.



Anyway, as for the momento i have Corisar enabled becuase i need to turn of the lights, but looks like theres something wrong with that soft."

			Hey everyone,

I haven't built a computer in maybe 10-15 years... since core 2 duo's were a thing and the intel ""i"" series was in 1st/2nd gen. Things get busy and life takes priority.

Anyways, thinking about building another pc. I'm a software dev and I do some gaming... so I'm wondering where the sweet spot is with cpu's these days.



I would like for somebody to give me ""the skinny"" on the current cpu situation.



Main questions:

1) Is it still worth it to always go intel? Is the cost of a mid-high end i-series worth it vs. a comparable performing amd ryzen?

2) Is now a good or bad time to buy/build? Anything new coming out soon that I should wait for?

3) which is the best bang for your buck, mid-high performance offering from both amd and Intel?

4) anything else you think i should take into consideration?



I was thinking of also building a basic server too- something that probably runs ubuntu server that funstions as a nas,  runs plex, maybe hosts some websites, maybe a LAMP testbed... but seeing as how they sell 8 year old dell power edge servers on amazon for 200$, I may just go that route, or just get a synology.

1.) Most people here will say ""no."" However, that's still up for some debate. Some people have had negative experiences with AMD processor based systems due to platform issues and will still go Intel. I will say that there are sometimes additional challenges that you face with AMD platforms, but they aren't insurmountable nor as bad as they were when each chipset was new. Conversely, Intel has far more rampant security problems though its still unknown how good or bad AMD CPU's truly are. Exploits effecting Intel systems sometimes still effect AMD. AMD's architecture isn't as well known and it is likely in whole or in part, an issue of security through obscurity. Meaning we don't know how well Ryzen will ultimately shake out on the security front for months or even years. 



2.) It's a solid time to buy AMD right now. If interested in going Intel, I would wait right now. 



3.) AMD's Ryzen 5 3600 or Ryzen 7 3700X are really the sweet spots for most people. On the Intel side, your looking at the 9600K or the 9700K. On the slightly higher end of that spectrum, the 9900K is also an option. It depends on what your doing as to how much you truly need to spend here. I'm assuming gaming, so best options are the 3700X and 9900K respectively. The AMD being far more bang for your buck. Although, some ground is lost on the expense of a decent X570 motherboard. The cheaper ones are of questionable quality in many cases. 



4.) Not really.

			One of my main concerns is that the current socket is going to be relevant for a couple more years... if it's on it's way out I would consider waiting for the next socket but if this one has some life left in it with some good upgrade paths, that will do! See, I don't even know what the current socket is called! I need to look it up lol

Intel's Z390 chipset and LGA 1151 socket are on their way out. There is no future upgrade path there. AMD's AM4 socket is good through 2020, but we don't really know beyond that. The fact is, AMD has used the same socket for about three years now and its grown from supporting only 8c/16t CPU's to 16c/32t. There are a lot of issues that come with broader CPU support on a single socket and I can get into that if you'd like, but its unlikely that AM4 has a long life ahead of it. Then again, we just don't really know at this point. AMD strives to maintain that compatibility as long as they can, but it creates additional design challenges for them. It also creates challenges for us as consumers."

and you'd be correct.. the i3-10100 is about as fast as the AMD R3 3100 and significantly slower than the 3300x when run at the memory specs that B/H400 series boards would be limited to.. if B/H series boards end up not being restricted to the 2666mhz memory limit then going up to 3200mhz add's about 10% which puts it closer to a stock 7700k but still not beating it. the 10300/320 likely won't make much of a difference either, maybe they'll match the 7700k on a z490 board."

He, but if your buying a 10900 for other work loads it's even worse.

I also said the 3600x/10600k fits the bill for a more broad base than 10900k/3950x.  If you need or have the $, you're not missing anything by going bigger.

			I have quite a lot of experience with the CPU in question as well as many X299 motherboards. I'd love to help you and answer your question. However, I can't understand what you are saying. Or, anyone here who speaks Spanish or (whatever that is) please translate. Google translate was used here and I can't make sense of it.



EDIT: If I am understanding this correctly, the question here is whether or not the ASUS X299 WS Pro is as fast as the X299 Prime Deluxe II or the MSI X299 Creator. If that is the case, then the answer is yes. Motherboards do not really determine the speed of the system. They have very little to do with it. The CPU's all use the same base clocks and the same turbo boost features. Motherboards all have pretty much the same values for everything that impacts performance out of the box.



Provided identical conditions these motherboards will all lead to the same level of performance. We've seen it countless times in the benchmarks results across motherboard reviews. The difference between motherboards comes down to a margin of error in the testing which is deemed acceptable. It's usually a 1-2% spread. The only area where one board may falter is if that board lacks certain specific features in the BIOS that could be used for performance tuning. Less expensive motherboards do not have all of the same features their more expensive counterparts do. However, this is something you won't even see when overclocking. The clock generators and VRM control of higher end boards usually amounts to more granular control over settings. Thus, you have more to work with when dialing in performance.



That said, you really have to be pushing the limits of what a CPU can do in order to see these differences. Typically, you won't even see much of a difference while using custom water cooling. You have to step up to LN2 before you really see differences between most of these motherboards. I usually see the exact same results overclocking a given CPU on a variety of boards. The difference between a cheap motherboard and an expensive one is usually about 100MHz if that.



However, memory tuning is another matter. Generally, the more expensive motherboards are far better at it. However, you need to buy RAM that's actually capable of achieving those speeds in the first place. That's the real issue as such memory is prohibitively expensive in most cases. Even then, it mostly comes down to what the more expensive motherboards can do in regard to tuning within the BIOS than it does the actual hardware. Hardware matters, and while price is something of an indicator as to what motherboard is better between the low and the high end, that's not always the case.



Anyway, the short version is this: If you were to compare your CPU on all of the motherboards you mentioned, your performance would be identical across them provided they were configured the same way. Your system isn't going to be faster with a more expensive motherboard, or one of a different model. Unless your talking about overclocking, in which case there could be a difference, but it isn't likely to be huge without stepping up to more exotic cooling methods.

			Thermal Velocity Boost is the technology Intel is using in the i9 10900k to achieve those speeds. Turbo Boost, the fallback boosting technology, will only get you to 5.1 Ghz.



TVB only ever works on one or two cores, and typically the cpu internal temps must be below 50C for it to ""boost"" up. It's not something that is meant to work all the time. The conditions have to be just right.



Intel has been marketing TVB at gamers or anyone using single threaded workloads. The irony is that only older games fall into that category. A newer or cutting edge game engine will never be single threaded. So TVB has limited use case.

I believe he's saying with the new card, non-overclocked he is not seeing as high of CPU %'s.  Not with the old card.  That said, I would try lower clock speeds, if the problem persists it may be some state or setting somewhere in the OC settings (or even windows power plan, something) that is causing it.  I would go back to where you know it's fine and then do a SINGLE thing at a time until you see it.  Aka, enable OC (But don't touch anything, check %).  Go back and adjust a SINGLE item and test, etc.  Slow painful testing is probably the only way to find out what's causing it unfortunetly.  Odd issue indeed though."

Yes, the ES chip can do 5.3 ghz all cores at around 1.310v-1.320v load or something.  But I'm having some weird issue where it seems (at least from a few quick tests) that using a cache ratio of x50 makes the system MORE stable than a cache ratio of x49!  I was getting CPU Cache L0 errors in Cinebench R20 at x53/x49 at 1.305v load.  ES CPU bug?  Or am I just cursed?  idk...Maybe everything's going to hell because the load temps are above 90C...and we don't talk about fight club when your load temps are above 90C!  But when I set cache to x50...it was stable? What...



My retail chip seems to need absurd volts for 5.3 all cores (like 1.4v at full load), but the 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 5 ghz voltages seem to be exactly the same load voltage requirement as my ES.

basically, the retail chip falls off at 5.2 ghz, and falls off HARD at 5.3 ghz."

I guess another plus is AMD is affordable to people with a lot less money which would mean ... a lot of people. So I am glad kids with a lot less money can at least have AMD in their corner. Also, after doing some research, it turns out that one of the major reasons Intel can out perform AMD at a hight NM process is their CPU tech. Apperently, Intel has 1000's and 1000's of patents pertaining to inside their CPU's, tech that AMD simply does not have. I've been reading that Intel at 10nm will still out perform AMD at 5nm, let alone their 7nm. Brand prediction, data gates, a lot of way over my head crazy stuff that Intel has. This is what give them the ability to overclock, etc. Very interesting stuff if you start digging in and reading.



I am so happy that AMD woke Intel up. This is going to be amazing ride in the coming years for all of us.



I picked up an Intel 10900K today at Microcenter and an Asus z490 ROG Maximus Hero Wifi along with Samsung B-Die 4400Mhz DDR4 memory. Second place has never ever really been something I've ever wanted to settle for. I anticipate having one of the worlds fastest gaming PC's once I am done.



Come to think of it, I think I understand who the 10900K is for, it's for people who are serious about gaming and won't accept anything but the fastest gaming experience you can buy.

Not sure why you thought the 3950x was for you if your primary goal is gaming.  That said, if you found 80* hot and you bought a 10900k.and plan to overclock.... You either have some substantial cooling (which should have had no problems with a 3950x) or you are likely going to see as high or higher temps.  The 3950x is for someone like me who plays games once i a while on a very GPU limited machine.  I mostly do development work (compiling, databases), some transcoding and just screwing with machine learning and misc other stuff.  It can be used for those that do other things besides just game... Some people leave their encodes running while gaming.. with 4/8 its really noticeable, with 16/32 you won't even notice.  It's for sure not for everyone and I don't pretend like it is.  3600x and 10600k(f) are the chips to look at for most use cases.  10900k and 3950x are for different niches."

			AMD has the most expensive chips now with Threadripper. In most games the MUCH cheaper 9900k will have faster average FPS, but there have been some instances where the TR chips actually improve Min and 1% FPS. It really depends.
		
		Click to expand...
	
HEDT chips are an oddity with games. They often suffer as gaming CPU's, but the Threadripper 3960X and 3970X really don't. However, most of their benefits in those scenarios likely come down to additional memory bandwidth. Even where you can demonstrate superior performance, the bang for your buck is simply not there. 



Even if you are building a no holds barred absolute ""best"" gaming rig possible type of system, its still incredibly hard to justify the additional cost. A decent X570 motherboard is going to be north of $250. The best Ryzen 3000 series CPU is the $750 Ryzen 9 3950X. The required TR40x motherboard is closer to the $600+ mark while the Threadripper 3970X itself is $2,000. I'd argue you really want liquid cooling for both, but its even more of a requirement with Threadripper. Fortunately, the only difference in cost between them on the cooling side comes down to the water blocks themselves. That said, there are likely cheaper AM4 blocks than there are sTRX4 compatible blocks. On that front, the difference is probably in the $50 range. In either case, probably not a deal breaker.



Between a 9900K and a 3950X, there are some games where the 9900K will definitely be faster and by a noticeable amount. What it really comes down to are the games you play and whether or not those titles behave that way and at what resolution this is apparent. Hitman 2 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are two examples where at both lower and higher quality graphics settings, a 9900K or any Intel CPU for that matter, are noticeably faster than their AMD counterparts."

			Yeah I returned my Ryzen 3950x ..... I mean, the productivity benches were kinda cool I guess, at the end of the day I'm a gamer so I'm not sure who that CPU is really for. I guess kids that stream and like to run render benchmarks over and over again. I also had a shit ton of issues with memory. I had to return 2 sets of 16gb because they just refused to work. Then, I found out you had to by ""Ryzen Approved"" DDR4 ... I mean, what the hell is up with that. Also, why couldn't I overclock the CPU to 5ghz like Intel? AMD is 7nm, Intel is 14nm? That makes NO SENSE to me. And under load, the heat was insane, Was hitting the high 80's. So returned it. Like I said, not sure who the Ryzen 3950x is for. Lots and lots of cons vs the ONE pro I could find and that was you get a few more cores. But, aren't most of us gamers?
		
		Click to expand...
	
ok


7nm is not as mature a process as 14+nm
7nm means that the size of the transistors is smaller, therefore they produce less heat but are more densely packed thus more heat is produced in a smaller area which means higher temperatures under load
It also means that it is harder to get heat away from the source.
Higher temperatures are inversely proportionate to speed, the faster you go, the hotter you get, you can’t go as fast if you are hot.
12-16 cores are not necessary for the majority of use cases at this time
12-16 threads is optimal for gaming at the high end of the scale, 8 is sufficient, 12 is very good, 16 is .. probably overkill in general.
8-10 threads is adequate for the majority of games these days (Starcraft 2 uses up to 4 reasonably well, AC:Origins/odyssey use 10-12, Doom eternal uses 14-15 albeit not putting all under load most of the time)
More cores is better for: Video rendering/compression, 3d rendering, compiling software, running benchmarks, deep learning/ai, Microsoft excel
For the vast majority of users these days 6 cores is enough, heck most can get by happily on 4.
Idling on the desktop and web browsing can be done happily on 2 cores or one core with 2 threads
Streaming and gaming can be done with QSV or Nvenc"

			DDR didn't show much of a performance increase on PIII era CPUs. Even most AMD K7 CPUs didn't show much of a benefit of having DDR.

 

 The only PIII chipsets that supported DDR were some via chipsets (and all via chipsets at that time had HORRIBLE memory bandwidth). I know abit and asus made boards but I doubt you'll be able to find any new ones any more. Look around the FS forums, maybe you can find something. But I really reccomend just looking for a nice SDRAM mobo like the Abit ST6.

 Seconded.  No damn sense in getting a DDR board for a Tualatin processor.  Scavenge cheap PC133 from anywhere and build your box.

 

 The only limitation to using the i815EP chipset for this is that it supports a max of 512MB memory.  If you want more, you're stuck with the 694T, and as BigBadBiologist said, VIA chipsets of that era weren't known for memory bandwidth.  You pays your money and you takes your chances."

We used to run those in the 90's, parts we'd scavenge from the e-waste pile.

I very quickly learned to pull apart my cases, cut away unneeded obstruction, and use women's nylons stretched across my intake area.

Way more work, but I didn't like running colo rated fans in my house.

All those early Slack linux guys were masochists and loved Sunon or Deltas.



I'd pull ODD support out of the way and zip tie ""large"" fans in place back when low 80mm intake/high 80mm exhaust was the common beige box layout.

When side ventilation became a huge design feature in cases most of the gamers I knew had been blasting a box fan into an open side since Quake 2.



I am still running no front on my define C bc I'm too cheap to buy a diff box.

Was running a vornado blasting into my 1080ti Armor while I was waiting for the AIO bracket to be delivered a few years ago.

			Thank you.



I guess another plus is AMD is affordable to people with a lot less money which would mean ... a lot of people. So I am glad kids with a lot less money can at least have AMD in their corner. Also, after doing some research, it turns out that one of the major reasons Intel can out perform AMD at a hight NM process is their CPU tech. Apperently, Intel has 1000's and 1000's of patents pertaining to inside their CPU's, tech that AMD simply does not have. I've been reading that Intel at 10nm will still out perform AMD at 5nm, let alone their 7nm. Brand prediction, data gates, a lot of way over my head crazy stuff that Intel has. This is what give them the ability to overclock, etc. Very interesting stuff if you start digging in and reading.



I am so happy that AMD woke Intel up. This is going to be amazing ride in the coming years for all of us.



I picked up an Intel 10900K today at Microcenter and an Asus z490 ROG Maximus Hero Wifi along with Samsung B-Die 4400Mhz DDR4 memory. Second place has never ever really been something I've ever wanted to settle for. I anticipate having one of the worlds fastest gaming PC's once I am done.



Come to think of it, I think I understand who the 10900K is for, it's for people who are serious about gaming and won't accept anything but the fastest gaming experience you can buy.

You must be trolling as their is way to much arrogance in that post.



It's like you are bitter that 'kids with less money' can get within 10% gaming of those with unlimited resources ... using a 2080ti at 1080p.



Then the node stuff.  First off, nobody except you was surprised that AMD did not shoot up to 5 ghz with a node shrink.  Smaller node does NOT isually mean higher clocks.



Glad you have been doing a lot of reading, but nobody believes that nonsense about 10nm Intel.  



Your entire post does not seem genuine.  ""serious about gaming and will not accept second best"":

If you are gaming, you should probably ask yourself? Have you maximized the performance of your 7820x yet ? A few questions.



1.) What voltage are you using to run at 4.7GHz ?

2.) What mesh speed are you running at ?   

3.) What memory are you using ? What speed? What timings?  

4.) What memory latency are you seeing in AIDA64 tests?

5.) What case are you using ? and what type of cooling solution are you using?  Air / AIO / Custom water cooling."

			I'm well aware of how 'most people roll here'... i've been on/around this forum since probably 2004 or so... took a hiatus from caring about pc hardware for about 10 years and forgot my registration info/password.

Anyways you said it in your last paragraph... I mentioned a few times that I'm not talking about max settings... and that everything I throw at my machine runs 'fine' at med-high settings. Clearly we have a divide in our opinions on what actually matters. If I can play the game and it looks alright, that's fine with me. I'm not looking at frame-rates or shadow quality or any of that. I've had $2500 builds, it's just not worth it to me anymore. I don't think you really read or understood what I was saying... of course there are good reasons to get high end stuff if you want the best gaming experience...



All I meant to say is that these days, things will run a lot smoother on just about anything you can buy new (hardware wise), a lot better than it used to in the past, in my opinion. If my dead grandmother's dell can run a new game without any lag... that's sayin' something

			Idk, I run my 2 monitors at 2560x1440 and don't have any issues and my specs are pretty basic... 8th gen intel i5 (don't remember clock speed), 16gb ram, low-end graphics card. I'm tellin ya, I think many people are just used to the way things used to be and simply haven't really tried ""lower end"" components because why would they. It is very very very seldom that anything really even gets my basic machine breathing heavy.
		
		Click to expand...
	
I don't agree with this at all. Frankly, I've tested lower end hardware and the statement is simply incorrect. At 1920x1080, you'd be able to make a fair case for some lower end hardware if your satisfied with medium settings in more modern games. That's just not how a lot of us roll here. This isn't oft|OCP. I've got a machine here with a Ryzen 7 2700X w/GTX 980 Ti and at 2560x1600, it's not able to maintain 144FPS (for 144Hz G-Sync) in Destiny 2 at maximum settings. Destiny 2 is actually fairly well optimized and runs very well given how good it looks. That machine can do 80-90FPS most of the time, even hitting 110FPS or so once in awhile but it does drop down to the 45-50FPS range quite often. 



At 3440x1440 or 3840x2160, you simply need more power. I've got an RTX 2080 Super and an RTX 2080 Ti here and the latter is what I'd consider the bare minimum for a good 4K gaming experience. Even at 3440x1440, that would still generally be the case in a lot of games. At 1920x1080, the case for more powerful video cards comes down to higher frame rates for higher refresh rate monitors. These things all make a huge difference. At 1920x1080, the 2080 Super delivers a fantastic experience and can even push really high FPS. But crank up the settings and resolution and that 2080 Super starts to falter. 



I've done the testing. I've reviewed lower end processors with higher end graphics cards and they do not get it done once you start cranking up the eye candy in more demanding games. It's the same thing with the video cards. For me, medium settings are a no go. I want maxed visuals at a minimum of 120FPS if I can get it. This cannot be achieved in more demanding games at decent resolution. For me, 1920x1080 is crap. Anything beyond a 24"" monitor and 1920x1080 looks absolutely terrible. An immersive experience demands a larger display as far as I'm concerned. That means higher resolution. Games are becoming increasingly multi-threaded. That means, there are good reasons to go beyond an i5 for gaming."

Faster CPU's will see higher minimums, maximums and averages in games. Even at higher resolutions, this holds true. Granted, I don't think a 4790K with a decent overclock would hold the OP back a whole lot, but a CPU that can clock higher like a 9900K will produce higher minimums at 4K. I found this out the hard way when my Threadripper 2920X had me dropping into the 45FPS range quite often at 4K playing Destiny 2 at max settings. On a 9900K, this doesn't happen.

It's undeniably a better processor, and it's likely but not guaranteed you could push the silicon harder. That doesn't mean the upgrade path makes a ton of sense for your use case.



If you found a great deal on a 10920x or higher *and* you were doing simultaneous CPU-driven transcoding work - like, say, x264 streaming to Twitch or the like - dramatically more cores could make a difference. But the new chips aren't a transformative leap ahead. If you're getting a reliable overclock and eight cores is enough for what you do, I'd hold your money back for a while.



edit: As Dan_D notes below, the upgrade will also give you 44 PCIe lanes versus the 7820x's 28, owing to the fact that the 10,000 series is all built on HCC silicon whereas the 7900x and below were built on LCC.

			What tests are you failing exactly?  You have an awfully low Vcore in that screenshot @ 4.4Ghz..Don't be afraid to feed these chips voltage, anything up to 1.45V is fine, although I doubt you would need more then 1.4V to reach 4.5Ghz..Many people will feed them 1.5V+, although I wouldn't recommend that on air, as your one core is already pushing close to 80C..The ""Westmere"" cores in these CPU's are built on the same process as Sandy Bridge, and we all know how much SB loves Voltage..There are guys that have been running extreme 5Ghz+ O/C's on the 2500/2600K's since launch day, what 3~3.5 years ago?



Are you running 3 X4GB of ram? Or 6x2GB? If it is the latter, your IMC likely needs more voltage, even running the ram @ 1600Mhz.









What? IBT is fine, as long as you test it properly.  You need to run it on ""Xtreme Mode"" with all available ram.  The best way to test with it is to launch the program, and then open task manager and lock the core affinity to the physical cores, in the OP's case Cores 0,1,2,8,9, and 10. 



There is nothing wrong with using Prime95 either.  It uses all available threads and uses the maximum amount of power of all the stres tests, thus producing the most amount of heat which is key to determining if your O/C is stable.

Those are merely numbers contributing to a point.  Suggest not focusing on that but the main point being made.



In 2020, someone looking to buy the ""best overall CPU"" (in a given class), regardless of minor differences in price, would not be leaning towards Intel.  And the 10900k, while a fine CPU in it's own right, clearly illustrates Intel's problems."

I mean, I like AMD and all and would recommend it, but I'm not a fan boi to the point I think Intel are POS.  They make good chips depending on your needs they can make sense.  At $220, it was a great deal for what you're getting.  It does a good amount better than a 3600x in gaming, but still falls short in highly threaded tasks (depending on what/how many you use).  You said you needed strong single core performance for some 3D games, which points straight to Intel.  If you do a bunch of other thing, or just like something new, zen3 is coming soon but we have no clue how much single thread gap it will close yet.  If you have patience, zen3 should at least be announced by the end of year with limited supply possibly.  I have a B450/1600 in my ITX desktop, just put together a B550 + 3700x for my son this past Monday, and the other 3 desktops are all Intel machines (6600k, and 2 G4560's for my daughters).  I'm curious to see what zen3 has to offer as I almost got 2x 3700x (one for my son and one for mine) but figured I'd hold off and see what's on offer at the end of the year."

You have to evaluate it in terms of how much it really cost you.  At full price, the overclock.net guys are probably correct.  At $220?  That's a totally different ball game.  The cheapest one on ebay is an ES 9900 chip that boosts 500Mhz less than yours and is $300 + S/H.  NE is selling your CPU for $440.  And at those prices, it makes NO sense as the 10700 is $335.  But at $220?  Heck, I'd trade you my 10700 for your 9900 + $100 cash ."

			Wow thanks for all of the input everyone. I'm not opposed to AMD, and have built a few systems with AMD chips in the past (am2 era)... Like now, I think it really just depends on the current state of the market that dictates which way I swing with cpu. I think as of recently it's the first time in a long time that it is actually a better choice to go with AMD... if what everybody is saying is true.



I may be the minority here, but I don't really care about clock speeds and spending an extra $200 for a few more fps. I play games but I've noticed something strange lately. I've been gaming on a HP pavillion I got for ~$300 used. It's got an 8th gen intel i5 and a 2GB GTX-something (don't even know) and it can handle just about every game I own and throw at it (and I buy new games all the time)... maybe not at max/ultra, but it can play everything and look pretty damn good while doing it. I don't remember this being the case years ago- where you actually needed high end gamer stuff to play pc games. I even play the witcher 3 on med/high.



I think what's happened is that hardware has advanced faster than gaming/graphics/whatever and is finally reaching a place where basic hardware that comes in stock branded desktops can handle games pretty well- especially the older games like dark souls and stuff like that... so I feel like super high end pc components is more of a niche hobby now more than ever, in that you don't really NEED the most expensive stuff to play games.



I'm a developer and a passionate tinkerer who plays some games (mostly mtg arena), so I do enjoy some speed, but I think splurging on the most expensive stuff is mostly for bragging rights these days (not that it hasn't always been). I just want something decent to code on and do what I do... I usually find that spending ~$13-1500 on a build is a sweet spot for me.



Thanks for all the suggestions everyone.

As for the IGPU, it is automatically disabled when you plug a GPU into the PCI, yet the 3GB RAM is still allocated to VRAM.  Now from what I understand system RAM comes first and foremost so if I used over 3GB of system RAM it would simply use more RAM for the system and less for VRAM so in the end I suppose other than the statement of an arbitrary static number showing up in DXDIAG it won't likely make any actual performance difference on my system.  That is what I am reading anyways, though I do kind of wonder if that is the case why we have had the ability to set this value ourselves in past BIOS utilities."

It's a pretty solid statement, you can hand a decade-old 980X to someone now and they're unlikely to notice its slow for day-to-day tasks, and a 2600K is pretty viable even for gaming.

The 10900K isn't exciting because it doesn't really improve on what Intel is good at (low latency and high clock speeds). Instead, it adds two more cores that no one really asked for (if you're married to the mainstream platforms and need cores, AMD is the undisputed best choice, and if your workload scales to 10 cores it could probably benefit from 12 or 16)."

What is Cannonlake? 

Cannonlake was apparently meant to be the succesor to Skylake, featuring 8 cores on the mainstream desktop with a token IPC jump of 5%~, but due to 10nm woes Desktop and Server Cannonlake were scrapped and were replaced with two 14nm desktop lineup slot ins, known as Kabylake and Coffee Lake respectively, I believe the server lineup was then replaced by Cascade lake, which is a Skylake SP refresh on 14nm++. Cannonlake is now Y/U dual core parts, likely due to yields, clocks and performance of Intel's first generation 10nm.



Source For 8 core Cannonlake 

The screen shot is quite old, from 2015.



Die Size: 

Cannonlakes 2+2 part is estimated to be 70.5mm^2 from a wafer shot taken by Ian Cutress from Anandtech 



Source



Features: 


Cannonlake will apparently feature GT2 40EUs based on Gen10 IGPU.
First Gen 10nm from Intel
It will feature 2 cores Y/U parts only. 5.2/15w respectively
It supports AVX512, more so than the Skylake SP core (and Icelake even more than that)

""Update: Intel has reached out to ET with the following comment: “We’ll be shipping our first 10-nanometer products near the end of the year beginning with a lower volume SKU followed by a volume ramp in the first half of 2018.”

Icelake is a new architecture, directly replacing the Skylake core that the 6th 7th and 8th gen processors all use. Icelake is based on Intel's second generation 10nm(+) It is rumored to feature 8 cores on the mainstream platform. There is very likely to be a long overdue IPC increase of 5-10%~ due to 10nm woes they had to delay Icelake(apparently), It was meant to come after Cannonlake desktop, but as we know that was scrapped and replaced with Kabylake and Coffeelake. 



Features: 


Icelake is to feature 10nm+, Intel's second generation 10nm
Icelake is apparently to feature upto 8 cores on the mainstream
Icelake is apparently to feature Gen11 IGPU Graphics, version and EU amount unknown
Apparently has 48kb L1 cache per core instead of 32kb on the Skylake core
Icelake MAY feature EMIB integration (unlikely IMO) 
Even more support for AVX512 instructions (as seen above)
Should range from Mobile all the way upto Server 
Icelakes Server platform is named Whitley

Availability:

This is a complete unknown. Likely to be very late 2018 (End of Q4) or Q1/Q2 2019





Tigerlake:



What is Tigerlake? 

Tigerlake is the supposed successor to Icelake (Intel have not confirmed if the Tigerlake name even exists at this point), Tigerlakes codename was published by Ashraf Essa at the Motley Fool, It will be based on Intel's third generation 10nm(++) and is likely only to be an optimization, like Kaby lake but not as lackluster.



Features:


Tigerlake apparently features Gen12 IGPU, version and EU amount unknown
Is built on the 10nm++ manufacturing process 
Will likely feature upto 8 cores, like Icelake 
Should also range from Mobile to Server 


Availability:

Yet again a complete uknown, likely EOY 2019 early 2020.



Update:



""I strongly believe that Tiger Lake will have an enhanced CPU core (either enhanced Ice Lake or something totally new)."" - Ashraf Essa on twitter.



""Murthy joined in late 2015, so I bet we see his influence on the 2020+ products. That means Tiger Lake."" - Ashraf Essa on twitter.



""Agreed, and that's what I think they'll do. Gen12 in Tiger Lake is the big clue -- it means they had time to plan integration of new IPs."" - Ashraf Essa on twitter.



Sapphire Rapids:



What is Sapphire Rapids? 

Sapphire Rapids is rumored to be THE biggest change Intel has made to their architecture since the introduction of ""Core"", It is rumored to be a ground up arch, clean slate, all new it is also rumored that it is SERVER ONLY, could this be the start of Intel's divergence for certain markets? (I.E Different arch for different markets such as Server, Desktop, Mobile ETC). 



Features: 


Apparently Sapphire Rapids is built on Intel's 7nm process, this would make sense as Intel is making their new processes Server and Mobile first.
Supposed successor of Tigerlake 
Likely to feature EMIB IMO to help with divergence between markets
Server/Workstation only
Server Platform is called Tinsley

			No worries, I got you. It's called AM4. For a PC enthusiast such as you, there's 2 AM4 chipsets you need to know: B series and X series. B series are for gamers/performance. X series is for overclocking the CPU and Xfire. Unless you plan on heavy overclocking, then B series is enough.



B350 was the old gen, B450 is current gen, and B550 is coming later this year.



X370 is old gen, X470 is current gen, and X570 is coming later.



The motherboard everyone recommends is the MSI Tomahawk B450 MAX.

X570 has been here for months. And no I wouldn’t say everyone recommends that board. If I’m already spending the money, I wouldn’t buy into a B series limited chipset.



I went with a x570 high end platform (Asus Crosshair 8) and a 3900x. Performance was on point for the money, in my case the best value for use.



all comes down to what someone wants to spend.

Here's a ""conclusions"" page.  Pretty much the same as before with the other locked chips.  You need to put it in a Z490 board to take advantage of memory overclocking and the ""max turbo"" overclocking and then it will be a decent CPU for the price.  If you're on a non Z chipset, you're stuck with 2666Mhz memory and most boards won't override the PL1 turbo and it drops performance in 1080p gaming some 6% which then means the Ryzen 3300x at the same price is a better buy (and is arguably anyway unless you want/need the IGP)."

Right - the GTX 2080 Ti broke  the usual delay for big GPU in the modern ""new process tech is hard"" era,  because 1: it was using an existing node, just BIGGER, and 2: without it the performance improvement over existing cards would have been ZERO (and when you're selling a hot new tech like RTX, performance improvement is king)!



In every card since he GTX 480, they've released the big boy 6 months to a year later.  AMD has also followed this cadence (Hawaii, then Fiji, then Vega, then Big Navi)."

			HEDT chips are an oddity with games. They often suffer as gaming CPU's, but the Threadripper 3960X and 3970X really don't. However, most of their benefits in those scenarios likely come down to additional memory bandwidth. Even where you can demonstrate superior performance, the bang for your buck is simply not there.



Even if you are building a no holds barred absolute ""best"" gaming rig possible type of system, its still incredibly hard to justify the additional cost. A decent X570 motherboard is going to be north of $250. The best Ryzen 3000 series CPU is the $750 Ryzen 9 3950X. The required TR40x motherboard is closer to the $600+ mark while the Threadripper 3970X itself is $2,000. I'd argue you really want liquid cooling for both, but its even more of a requirement with Threadripper. Fortunately, the only difference in cost between them on the cooling side comes down to the water blocks themselves. That said, there are likely cheaper AM4 blocks than there are sTRX4 compatible blocks. On that front, the difference is probably in the $50 range. In either case, probably not a deal breaker.



Between a 9900K and a 3950X, there are some games where the 9900K will definitely be faster and by a noticeable amount. What it really comes down to are the games you play and whether or not those titles behave that way and at what resolution this is apparent. Hitman 2 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are two examples where at both lower and higher quality graphics settings, a 9900K or any Intel CPU for that matter, are noticeably faster than their AMD counterparts.

			That’s a bit disingenuous. TR is more expensive, but is meant for a completely different use case. 



   The cheaper 3900X is better than the 9900k at most everything that higher price isn’t really justified by the better gaming performance.

If it's for gaming you should keep the 7820x for a while. It's just the GPU that will very likely make a change in 2020. You will need to get a high en gaming card, wait for Ampere probably. AMD seems to be doing catch-up only. Will let you run 4K with ray tracing and the CPU may still not matter if it's already 8 cores."

I am reading that 11th gen rocketlake will be compatible with Z490 so if I switched that would get me another solid 2-3 years of an upgrade path.  AMD is also coming out with ZEN 3 Q4 2020 but that'll be the last CPU on AM4 so that has no upgrade path although I'm sure it's going to be a great CPU.



I'm really torn of what to upgrade to at this point.  I primarily game and now have a 4k / 120hz monitor so I really need all the horsepower I can get.

For XP the best platform would be something like Ivy/Sandy Bridge and these easily support 4GB memory and even more and Windows 10 to make for normal usable PC for today."

I spent considerable time looking at new cases, before stumbling on a really easy way of controlling fans and monitoring load: Argus Monitor.



While it is registered software (USD$19.99/3 years of updates), it's a lot less expensive than buying a new case or cooler. After carefully adjusting fan profiles now the machine whisper quiet, I'm very impressed. It's also allowed me to tune based on averages eg. cpu temperature over 10 secs, as opposed to just cpu temperature, which is more valuable as it means the fans aren't pulsing.



It also shows the effect of speedstep graphically which is kind of nice.

So, not really sure what your argument is.  Neither deserves a free pass, and the argument that some people gave AMD a free pass doesn't make it right.  Taco at the time didn't know what the issue was, but jumped to the defense of ""it says up to"".  I haven't heard this complaint before so I didn't think it was a widespread issue, just wanted to point out nobody should get a free pass.

Don't worry about seeing the CPU usage.  If you properly disable the hyperthreaded cores, you should sit right @ 50% usage..The important thing is that you watch the GFlops output in IBT..They should be higher then they were in your screenshot above..



It appears that you only have 3 cores active..Notice that 2 of them are running @ 100%, and the third is loaded heavily as well..You may need to play around with which cores to turn off since a Xeon is different then the native 4 core dies with HT..with those, you just do like Axarie said and turn off the odd number cores..



In your case, based on your screenshot from before, it appears that cores 0,1,2 and 8,9,10 are the physical cores in your CPU..Try locking IBT to those cores, and monitor the GFlop output..it should be higher then those results in your first screenshot.



It seems like you are stable, if you can pass everything you have and been able to game without issues as well.  The issue where the system was doing a hard power off when loaded is most likely due to the Vcore being too low..



I had that issue when fine tuning my 3770K on my MSI Z77 MPower..Everything would be stable for hours and hours, and then I would get a random hard reboot.  I had to boost my Vcore and then give my IMC a tiny bit of juice as well."

7820x + 1080tis bc all of the sudden I went from simple cloud native .js builds to needing a local Kubernetes and python validation box.  The AWS spend just throwing spaghetti against the wall from serverless and machine learning was truly stupid.  Also played a lot of Blackout in my downtime.  Got off the 7820x bc I was playing more than working late 2018.



That arc got straightened out so I decided to screw around with Ryzen just to see what it was about on Win10 and Linux.  Rhel and Ubuntu worked fine, Android emulator issues made it a no go. This was March 2019 or around the lead in to 1903 so it was fun seeing everything Ryzen could do in a more stable state.



Got off mobile fronted applications that needed a bunch of data tier testing and bought a 2600 to game.  Games just felt a little off during the whole ryzen arc.  Flick movement was off, shots felt a little sticky.



Game builds mid 2019 started to show 100% core useage so a 1700x went in.  Recording sucked at times due to OBS issues.  All that went away with +2 cores.  Went back to nvenc.   MW beta felt off.  Sold off that Ryzen platform and ran a 3600 briefly in my other b450 rig that my buddy had me build.  It fixed some of the 1% lows that made gaming feel off but wasn't as good as an 8700k.  Linux was good, especially for those builds that used to take 20mins.



Currently on a 9700kf for games, everything feels good again.  I don't want Ryzen as my primary gaming platform, it's fine for Dev.  I'm too sensitive to stickyness.



The whole time I was using an aio cooled 1080ti.

Bought an X34, xb1, Asus 180hz 1080p rog monitor.  Gpu and monitor speed drives everything.  Pure gaming no Dev I'd get a Dell 27"" 1440p tn panel bc that looked fine and felt the fastest.  I wouldn't want to stare at a pair of them for 8+ hours a day.  I need a 1080ti minimum at low graphics settings or fps gaming is pointless.



Cpu does matter to tighten up moments when you need to wipe a quad on your own or get 3rd partied and need to hit a 10+ kill streak.  It's doable on Ryzen, it's just easier on 8c consumer Intel.



X299 is fine for gaming, it's not as bad as Ryzen.

I wouldn't spend more on it, the $ is better served on gpu/monitor.

If that's maxed out then a consumer platform if ideal for a consumer workload.

1600af + b450 is cheap enough to try my arc."

No, it's probably a B batch.  The average chip reaches 5.2 on all cores, not 5.3.

5.3 on all cores is A batch.  Remember the Intel turbo boost specifies 5.1 on all cores for a light load on 2 cores above 70C, and 4.9 all cores below 70C and 4.8 all cores above 70C.



The vids on the retail chip are identical to my ES at 4.7-5.1 ghz, but the 5.2 ghz VID is 35mv higher on the retail chip than the ES chip.  So I'm guessing the 5.3 point is maybe 50mv higher (there is no new VID programmed on either chip for 5.3 vs 5.2)"

			Hi. I have a 2013 desktop and the Coolermaster Seidon 120mm Water cooler system is starting to make gargling sounds sometimes so I am going to replace it (I have a spare unit).

And while I am doing that I would like to see if I can upgrade the processor to something better. It's older tech so if something better is still available it may be affordable now.



My Motherboard is: ASUS P9X79 Pro X79 Quad Crossfire/3way SLI SATA 3 USB LGA 2011

My Processor is Intel i7 3930K 3.2Ghz 12MB LGA 2011 Retail

My GPU is Nvidia GTX 780 3GB GDDR5

System Ram is maxed at 64GB

Still running WIN 7 PRO 64

Except for all SSDs now the system is hardware-wise still like it was ordered back in 2013.



What I would like to accomplish is improving it's 3ds Max and Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 performance.  My newer i7 Laptop actually performs a little better than the desktop (also has an 8GB quadro).



So what processor could I change to that would still be supported by my system?

and if I change processor will it break all my software licenses due to the hardware change?

No, no voltage/temp threshhold, it just cycled below because of lack of instantaneous load. Note peak temps were still below 80C, no way it was thermally/voltage throttling . I'll run Davinci for the entire encode if you prefer.



Thing is, you don’t need the processor to be running at 5ghz constantly, and it is not designed to do that.



It is one thing to say the 9900k is a hot processor, another to say “it’s a hot processor when you’re running it at maximum speed constantly”. You don’t redline an engine constantly when you’re driving at 10kph/mph, why should you do that when you’re running a chip? You also don’t need a fire breathing v8 to drive granny down to the shop (notice all those cores sleeping in the apex legends shot?)



It should be abundantly clear by now that my preference is not to do that. I don’t want my rig to burn power unnecessarily."

2) Is now a good or bad time to buy/build? Anything new coming out soon that I should wait for?

4) anything else you think i should take into consideration?

1) No.



2) Now is a good time. RAM is cheap, SSD costs have come down, CPU sockets have great upgrade paths.



3) AMD best performance/dollar - Ryzen 5 3600. Intel best performance/dollar - i5-9400F.



4) This is just an overview to get you reacquainted. It's always best to read a few articles and research a little before pulling the trigger."

so 4.4 at that vcore is very great.

what is your motherboard?

do you changed vcore only?



are you using prime 28.x or older?

Oh, hey! Sorry, I wasn't paying attention to the thread.



I am using the Asus X99-Deluxe - in my original post I was using the 0801 BIOS,  but now I'm on the 0904.



There was a post by Raja - an Asus representative on the Asus X99 forums here and in Overclock.net - where he mentioned that version 27.9 of Prime95 was recomended for some reason... sooo, that's what I'm using. I'll try to find the link to the post as I'm having a hard time finding it right now.



I only changed the vcore originally, though I've changed the CPU Input Voltage to 1.9v now too. That and the multiplier set to 44x is everything I've moved so far."

It's expensive, burns power like crazy, and still falls short on many things.  Yes, it can give you a few more FPS at low resolutions, if that's your thing sure.

Over 90C with liquid cooling.. at 4.8ghz

And others saying similar

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tomshardware.com/amp/news/intel-core-i9-10900k-stress-test



So unless you spend some serious coin on the cooling good luck maintaining boost.  It just doesn't have a lot going for it.  Still gets beat by 3900x in threaded loads, still slightly out in front in low resolution gaming, use a crap ton of power to do it.  Just isn't a ton to get a excited about.  Hopefully we will see some real benchmarks but I haven't seen to much reason to be hopeful.



Edit.  You said your struggling to maintain 4.8... so does this chip with a 240mm radiator at over 90C.  Unless you're really hitting a wall in something specific, your not missing much."

			That 9900 is a no-brainer.  Everyone is gaga over AMD these days, but for the things most people actually do with them, they're not really that much faster (if at all) than a competing Intel product, and you're certainly not going to get a faster AMD part that cheap.



Edit:  Subjectively, I don't really like my 3600/B450 setup that much.  I get some quirky behavior sometimes that I don't get on any of my various other (Intel) machines.  I can't be sure it's the fault of the platform, but it feels like it is, and I don't think I'd buy another Ryzen setup, even if it's cheaper than Intel for similar performance.



It's sort of understandable that someone posting on overclock.net would poo-poo a CPU that isn't overclockable.  If what they do is overclocking, then a CPU you can't overclock isn't very useful to them, is it?  That said, my 9900K was an awesome CPU at the stock speed.  I wish I had a second one, even if it's not overclockable.



I say get the 9900 and go play some games or whatever it is you intend to use it for.  Life is too short for this sort of hand wringing.

I had to opposite, I had some quirky issues with my 6600k that were completely solved when I switched to the 3700x.  We would get stuttering in games running 90fps.  Swapped the 3700x and it is completely smoothed out.  My 1600 has been rock solid too.  Just some people have good/bad luck or some quirky software somewhere that causes stuff and gives them a bad taste in their mouth, which is understandable.  I have had issues with both over time, but neither has been that much better/worse.  Of my 5 main desktops (in use daily) 3 are Intel 2 are AMD."

The 8600k will match the 8700k in pretty much all games except maybe Civilization.  So what is the point of the 8700k?  Same gaming performance with better productivity.  Why not something with the same gaming ability with even MORE productivity.  It would be an attractive option over simply 15% better gaming.



What will be interesting is if Intel implements an AMD-like precicion boost into their new 8-core.  Even with great cooling, it is hard to imagine the 8-cores going much over 4.5 ghz due to thermals.  It would be really solid if they have the chips boost closer to 5.0 ghz on lower thread workloads so as not to lose the advantage to the 8700k in those scenarios."

Where would you be looking to put the AIO?  Top exhaust?  Front intake?  Intake, in theory, would have lower CPU temps, but higher GPU temps, and exhaust would theoretically be the other way around.

			No, the key reason that intel is “still in the game” is because most software is compiled with their chips in mind first.

No, that really isn't it.



The real reason is that: Intel has better inter-process and cache latency.  Games don't have completely independent threads. They frequently need to to pass information between them, and they get preempted more causing cache hits.  Clock speed boost is just icing on the cake.



AMD excels at things like Cinebench, because that software is running relatively independent work on each thread, that seldom preempted, so the latency penalty is negligible.



You can see the same thing inside the Ryzen family, 3300X can be up to 15% faster 3100 at when gaming at equal clock speed.  That isn't because games were designed for Intel. It's because 3100 has that inter-CCX latency, while 3300X doesn't, and you can see that the 3300X is almost identical in performance to a 7700K.



If Zen 3 has an 8 core CCX, that should lower latency on, on 6-8 core parts with a single CCX as well, making them very competitive for gaming, with a couple more tweak they might even take the crown."

			What I am most excited about is the return of the 8700K, now as an i5 at a lower price point, and maybe even the return of the 7700K, as lower priced i3.



You might try delidding and Liquid Metal on that 8700K, if you feel it's holding you back, but really I think you you wouldn't even notice a difference with i9 10900K, over your 8700K, except when the benchmark reports it's number.



Just because something faster exists, doesn't mean it would actually produce a meaningful benefit for you.









Intel's biggest problem with 10nm going forward, is that their 14nm was too damn good. Now 10nm can't really compete on the desktop where clock speed is king.



Even TSMC 7nm would be a downgrade for Intel vs its 14nm on Desktop.  It's possible we might never see another 5GHz+ desktop CPU from anyone, below 14nm.
		
		Click to expand...
	
I agreed I'm more interested in the low-mid range offerings, to many PCs to upgrade to sort about the fastest.  Also partially agree on the 14nm being to good, I think the biggest issue was they where able to pull so much frequency out of it, when they got 10nm going and couldn't get the speeds high enough it would have been impossible to sell.  If their 14nm called out at 4.5ghz it would have left a lot more room for 10nm, but they just refined it so much it took way longer to get 10nm up to speed.

Remember though, 10nm was supposed to be out before they got so high in the frequency, I think a combination of delays and subsequent refinement of 14nm together really made the issues worse.



Should see where things are soon, wating on benchmarks and real reviews, but normally rumors boost things up, but they haven't been to kind so far.  I feel it's going to be more cores, more heat, slight increase in some metrics, but nothing that's going to make anyone to excited to upgrade from a recent build. Maybe someone from an older build though."

Everyone is gaga over AMD these days, but for the things most people actually do with them, they're not really that much faster (if at all) than a competing Intel product, and you're certainly not going to get a faster AMD part that cheap.



Edit:  Subjectively, I don't really like my 3600/B450 setup that much.  I get some quirky behavior sometimes that I don't get on any of my various other (Intel) machines.  I can't be sure it's the fault of the platform, but it feels like it is, and I don't think I'd buy another Ryzen setup, even if it's cheaper than Intel for similar performance.



It's sort of understandable that someone posting on overclock.net would poo-poo a CPU that isn't overclockable.  If what they do is overclocking, then a CPU you can't overclock isn't very useful to them, is it?  That said, my 9900K was an awesome CPU at the stock speed.  I wish I had a second one, even if it's not overclockable.



I say get the 9900 and go play some games or whatever it is you intend to use it for.  Life is too short for this sort of hand wringing."

I thought the processor was better because it's newer but I looked up the specs and that is not so.



Laptop:  i7 6820HQ

4 Cores, 8 Threads @2.7 GHz, Skylake.

Release date ≈ Q4 2015. 

64 GB RAM



Desktop: i7 3930k

6 Cores, 12 Threads @3.2GHz, Sandy Bridge-E.

Release date: Q4 2011.

64GB RAM



The old Desktop CPU is better.  So that would seem to mean that the difference is either due to the SSD drive speeds and/or GPU.

The Laptop has C:\ SSD and the other drives are NVME

The Desktop has all SSD drives.

They both run Win 7 Pro



Laptop GPU Quadro M5000M 8GB

Desktop GPU GTX 780 3GB



The reason I'm looking at this is I've been looking how involved it will be to change the processor to Xeon and cooling in my desktop and am dreading it.  If I could get my desktop performance a little better I would be happy. If it were as good as the laptop that would be ok.

I do not know if the speed is due to drive speed or GPU?

I can't just slap a new GPU into the desktop because some Adobe CS6 features aren't supported in the new GPUs so I am most likely limited to using an old model GPU like original TITAN 6GB?

Thoughts?  Changing CPU to Xeon with 8/10 cores and 20/25MB cache still best way to go?"

Lower stock turbo than the 32-core.  And over 400w full-load if you bother to do it manually.



You only need the 3960x to double your memory bandwidth over the 3950X.  That's the only gaming performance increase magic going on here.



Very little performance gains doubling your core count ((outside scientific computations / rendering)



And you also have the added confusion of  Windows Processor Groups - unless you goo through the trouble of acquiring a Windows Enterprise licenses

It's a bit of a mess throwing more than 64 threads at windows, so why pay an extra $2000?.  Even Handbrake only scales by 33% per-core once you get above 8 cores, so why go above 32?

Have you installed the latest inf drivers for the chipset?

Have you tried it without hardware duty cycling?
Can you isolate it to core parking (disabling speedshift and HDC)?

			Lower stock turbo than the 32-core.  And over 400w full-load if you bother to do it manually.



You only need the 3960x to double your memory bandwidth over the 3950X.  That's the only gaming performance increase magic going on here.



Very little performance gains doubling your core count ((outside scientific computations / rendering)



And you also have the added confusion of  Windows Processor Groups - unless you goo through the trouble of acquiring a Windows Enterprise licenses



https://www.anandtech.com/show/15483/amd-threadripper-3990x-review/3

It's a bit of a mess throwing more than 64 threads at windows, so why pay an extra $2000?.  Even Handbrake only scales by 33% per-core once you get above 8 cores, so why go above 32?

			either a top-end corsair AIO (lots of experience with them), Noctua NH-D15, or water if I feel like taking on a project.  Most likely the best AIO or the D15 - I tend to prefer the AIOs.  Going into a PC-O11, so plenty of room for the rad.



9900K with the Ultra is cheaper than the 10700 plus a Z470 board.



Thoughts on the cooling?  I always spend on the case and the cooling - the cooling is always worth it, and the case makes life fun building it.
		
		Click to expand...
	
The Gigabyte ultra board I swear by, it's a nice piece of kit.



I have a NH-D15 on my 9900k.  Recently I've spent a lot of time looking into cooling options cause I am overclocking (5ghz, no avx offset) and I have hacked my case to try and make it quieter. I've even gone so far as to look at custom cooling and various exotic thermal pastes. Currently actual full load rendering temps on my machine are high 70s with 18C ambient. I've had to undervolt to make that happen. I recommend an undervolt even if you're not changing clock speed. I am not prepared to go with high 80s-mid 90s for general temps under load - hence sticking to 5ghz as a peak.



I would definitely make sure there is plenty of case airflow if you're going with a D15 or equivalent, modifying my (albeit cheap) case for airflow meant 15C degree drops in temperature. I am looking at replacing the case soon with something higher end and quieter. Currently looking at the Fractal design define S2 and R6, leaning towards the former for layout, but the latter has extra side sound dampening and the case sits behind a desk so windows are pointless for me.



If you are definitely not going to overclock or only shooting for a small overclock and want an AIO, then a 280mm based cooler would be fine, I'd recommend Corsair or NXZT as they have long warranties (5 & 6 years respectively) - I would not go a 2y warranty unit such as an arctic or thermaltake.



If you are planning a moderate overclock, I'd definitely consider a 360mm unit. Alphacool have a 420mm unit but the 2 year warranty worries me.



My chip can probably do 5.1/5.2ghz without too much drama, but I don't have the cooling in my case to do it. Heat output goes up substantially every 100mhz from 4.7ghz with AVX, stock AVX under all core load is 4.4ghz.  The majority of chips will do 5.0ghz all cores, some will go above, in rare instances you may be able to hit higher (eg 5.3/5.4) with sufficient cooling. I got lucky with my cache and it will do 4.7ghz, many chips hit the wall at 4.5ghz.



Remember at 5ghz, 100mhz is 2.5% so the question becomes: is it worth spending 15% more power for that extra 2.5% processor performance?



The KF chips tend to overclock more than the K chips, but I have learned from experience it is always useful to have a backup graphics port."

This is all speculation since I don't have hands-on experience with -T series Intel parts, but I would guess the 8100T would actually consume/dissipate right around its rated TDP. Thats my intuition based on the frequency and number of cores. It won't go over its TDP like i5/i7/i9 chips will because the i3 doesn't have turbo boost but 35W sounds about right for 4 cores and 3.1Ghz. Of course I could be totally wrong!"

Yeah I returned my Ryzen 3950x ..... I mean, the productivity benches were kinda cool I guess, at the end of the day I'm a gamer so I'm not sure who that CPU is really for. I guess kids that stream and like to run render benchmarks over and over again. I also had a shit ton of issues with memory. I had to return 2 sets of 16gb because they just refused to work. Then, I found out you had to by ""Ryzen Approved"" DDR4 ... I mean, what the hell is up with that. Also, why couldn't I overclock the CPU to 5ghz like Intel? AMD is 7nm, Intel is 14nm? That makes NO SENSE to me. And under load, the heat was insane, Was hitting the high 80's. So returned it. Like I said, not sure who the Ryzen 3950x is for. Lots and lots of cons vs the ONE pro I could find and that was you get a few more cores. But, aren't most of us gamers?"

			Intel has been nothing but a huge disappointment as of late. Not only they couldn't get 10nm out of the door, which is probably obsolete considering that AMD is already on 7nm and by the time when Intel does use 7nm for their products, AMD most likely would have moved to an advanced lower node which makes 7nm already obsolete. How the mighty has fallen when Intel was in the lead for a decade.



Not sure why they are asking so much for their Z490 boards, it looks like a refreshed Z390 with a different socket without PCI-E 4.0. Even if the 10900K does manage to outperform the 3900x, they have no answer to the 3950x which is already a loss for Intel there.
		
		Click to expand...
	
It probably has to do with the 250watts required NOT overclocked... And early indications show it is slower than 3900x in threaded loads (generalizing with limited data, need real benches to confirm).  It also needs to keep (going by memory) 75C to not throttle... Considering it runs over 90C while throttling with a 240mm radiator, this is a bigger ask than what people are used to."

			My bad...I missed the sig.  Yes, you probably would get better results with a 240mm AIO, but I'm not sure how much better it would be and whether or not it would be worth it.  Did you try a 2nd fan in push/pull on the 212?  I would guess you'd probably get a 5-10C drop with a decent 240mm+ AIO (CPU), but it's not like you have abnormal temps as it is now.



Where would you be looking to put the AIO?  Top exhaust?  Front intake?  Intake, in theory, would have lower CPU temps, but higher GPU temps, and exhaust would theoretically be the other way around.  How much lower temps?  And the cost?  Honestly, I wouldn't worry about it too much unless you were going to upgrade your CPU.

I'll try and add another fan on the 212. It's pretty damn good for non oc. Temps barely reached 55C on CPU.

If the difference is $13 it would take you 260 days to break even in power savings.  Once again, assuming a 24/7 load.

			Not sure why you thought the 3950x was for you if your primary goal is gaming.  That said, if you found 80* hot and you bought a 10900k.and plan to overclock.... You either have some substantial cooling (which should have had no problems with a 3950x) or you are likely going to see as high or higher temps.  The 3950x is for someone like me who plays games once i a while on a very GPU limited machine.  I mostly do development work (compiling, databases), some transcoding and just screwing with machine learning and misc other stuff.  It can be used for those that do other things besides just game... Some people leave their encodes running while gaming.. with 4/8 its really noticeable, with 16/32 you won't even notice.  It's for sure not for everyone and I don't pretend like it is.  3600x and 10600k(f) are the chips to look at for most use cases.  10900k and 3950x are for different niches.

On the normal CPU side of things, a 4960x would get you 300mhz and the slightly newer \ faster Haswell architecture but is still very expensive for an antiquated CPU. 



Some of the Xeon options would give you a couple more cores if your software would take advantage of that. The Intel Xeon E5-2667 v2 would give you 2 more cores without a hit to the clock speed. While the Intel Xeon E5-2690 v2 would give you 4 more cores but you would lose 300mhz.

			Yeah I returned my Ryzen 3950x ..... I mean, the productivity benches were kinda cool I guess, at the end of the day I'm a gamer so I'm not sure who that CPU is really for. I guess kids that stream and like to run render benchmarks over and over again. I also had a shit ton of issues with memory. I had to return 2 sets of 16gb because they just refused to work. Then, I found out you had to by ""Ryzen Approved"" DDR4 ... I mean, what the hell is up with that. Also, why couldn't I overclock the CPU to 5ghz like Intel? AMD is 7nm, Intel is 14nm? That makes NO SENSE to me. And under load, the heat was insane, Was hitting the high 80's. So returned it. Like I said, not sure who the Ryzen 3950x is for. Lots and lots of cons vs the ONE pro I could find and that was you get a few more cores. But, aren't most of us gamers?

I was in the EXACT same boat...  I fell into all the ""hype"" created around that cpu upon launch and thought it would make a great gaming cpu along with a ""do anything"" pc, and it was great at multi tasking, not knocking that at all, but gaming...... Ill take a hard pass.  I OC'd my 3950 to 4.6 on ccd0 and 4.4ccd1 and this 10900k at complete stock (for games) blows it away.

By the time they get 7nm down most of the chip at that time will be 10nm with some 12 nm here and there and the new 7nm in places. And at 5nm the same story. 



However less than 5nm we may encounter a wall. Where electrons quantumly just ignore the gate and hope right around or through it to the atoms on the other side of the gate on the drain end. Or you get drain end electrons hopping through the gate onto the source. We ARE going to have to find a new tech to stop this from happening, some exotic blend of material, or just abandon silicon and go organics or some other interesting tech.

			Definitely try the latest bios. According to the CPU support page, your board has very limited Ivy Bridge E/EP support, and frankly I think it's weird that they support some 4600v2 series, but none of the 1600v2s.



BUT Good news: If your chip still doesn't work, the E5 4627v2 is supported. 8 cores, 3.3GHz (3.5 all core), only 16MB L3 cache, though, compared to the 1680v2's 25, but it is an option. The bonus is that I found two on Ebay for less than $70.

I did see that the official support page doesn't list this CPU, but if you look, they say NONE of the Asrock Extreme x79 line supports it. And I've definitely seen people across the net at a few places saying they had it running on various boards in that line, including the Extreme4 (might've even been the 4-m, can't remember).



I was 99% certain I already had the latest BIOS version, but checked and discovered that there is a beta version that's more recent, so I updated and... nothing. Same result. Right now I'm wondering if it could have something to do with the vcore setting not being adequate. When I reset cmos with the button on the mobo it reverts to an 'auto' setting for vcore. I'm going to try setting it to fixed and giving a bit higher voltage than I use with the 4930k since I always seem to see people saying it needs a little more juice."

So the framerate doesnt change in games whether youre at stock 4.3, or OC 5.0? Also, were these issues present with your old GPU?



The only time ive seen things like this are with a slightly unstable OC (even RAM would do it too, not sure if you OC that), but I have seen CPUs that will either go from normal usage to 0 - 5%, or run at near full max constantly when under load due to a slight instability. Maybe try dropping clocks on your CPU a bit? Do a 4.8 run or somthing that might be a little more stable?

I just received a 1680v2 from eBay today. Dropped it in, smeared some MX4, and went into the BIOS - 1.25v and said ""meh, lets try a 45 multiplier"" and booted.... right up. Benchmarks, 3dmark, etc and everything is stable. Temps are higher than my 3930k and hit low 70s under the benchmark load - CPUmark is about 19200 - this isn't too far off from a 3800x which (rounding up) is about 24k. For a CPU that's seven years old, that's pretty amazing. Totally worth the $180.

I would def say try overclocking as well. Worst case you don't get much out of it and upgrade the cpu anyway. You may want to re-apply thermal paste too, just to help with temps if they get high when doing the overclock.

CPU 0 -

CPU 1 -

CPU 2 -

CPU 4 - 

CPU 5 - 

CPU 6 - 

CPU 7 - 

CPU 8 - 

CPU 9 - 

CPU 10 -

CPU 12. 



you have to uncheck 1-3-5-7-9-11. that just to make it easy to disable hyperthreading anytime fast without reboot. in any case disable hyperthreading in Bios its the same.

I get it with SL.  They still have to run a business and warranty claims can be problematic, so they are probably conservative with their numbers.



So I set the PL1/PL2 to 225W.  Tau is set to 128 seconds, but I don't think it will make a difference since PL1/PL2 are the same.  I set the BCLK to 102 and my all core OC is ~4.7Ghz, single core ~4.9Ghz.  This is all running on air on my old OG Scythe Fuma.  IBT short run gets me around 75C and 160W power draw.  I might give 103 a go later, and that should net me another ~50Mhz on both single and all core.



Honestly, for $335, I can't complain.  I get 2C/4T more than the 10600k for slightly more money (much greater availability).  I bought a Z490 board anyway for the flexibility, but with manufacturers allowing power limit adjustments on the B460 boards, you can get a lot of bang for the (Intel) buck."

			75% is a little extreme.  50% is more realistic depending on which chip you buy.  A 2600 for example was $199 and now is usually $99 on a super sale or $119 normal pricing.  The 2700X was $329 and is now ~$159.  2700 was $299 and is $149.  All of which represent fantastic bang for the buck.



1st gen Ryzen might be around 75% (or more seeing as the 1800x was a $499 launch price part).  But I would have a hard time recommending them since the 2XXX series has much better memory compatibility.

This is the naked X5670.



Steps and tips:



If anyone wants to give this a go it's actually pretty straight forward, here are my recommendations:


Use a short box cutter blade (the type that is shaped like a triangle with a corner cut off) and use a pair of locking pliers to hold it, this gives you way more control over the blade and how much force to use when cutting the silicone, it will also save your fingers from pain.
When cutting the silicone, press and wiggle the blade back and forth its much cleaner and easier this way, don't try to cut it by dragging the blade around the edge.
Use only one blade
Put your blade in to one corner, then use a pre-heated stove element to heat the spreader to melt the solder, the CPU will ""pop"" off (you will actually hear a ""pop"") leave the spreader on the element and lift off the CPU, slide the spreader off the element only after the CPU is removed otherwise it will just set again and you will have to heat it once more to remove it.
Heat the remaining solder and wipe it off with something rather than try to cut it off with a blade, finish off with a polishing cloth to give it a good flat finish.


Further notes:



You must remove the retention clip otherwise your heatsink or waterblock will fail to make contact with the CPU core. There are two possible ways to do this:

The easiest way is to remove the entire bracket by unscrewing it. 

Another, possibly better way is to remove the top part of the mechanism and lever, leaving the back plate and surround still on the board, this has the benefit of reducing the amount the motherboard flexes when pressure is applied to the socket. If you decide to go this route you need to make sure the HSF/WB sits completely inside the retention bracket (mine does with room to spare).



When screwing on the HSF/WB it becomes very difficult to screw it on flat, don't be too concerned, just don't screw it on too tight or you will kill the CPU like I did 

As you screw the HSF/WB on get a torch and check the clearance of the HSF/WB, it should be around half a mm clearance between each edge of the socket and your HSF/WB, not enough pressure and the pins won't make adequate contact with the CPU, you may not get post or have only some of your RAM show up if you don't have enough pressure on the CPU.



Final note: delid isn't worth the risk IMO, I killed a Xeon and an i7 930 from suspected over tightening of my WB, the CPU worked fine for quite a while but when I swapped out the motherboard I was careless and killed a couple of CPUs all too easily. The temp difference is marginal, my first impression was that there was a significant drop, and have seen others report that they can run lower volts on delided CPUs, however in my own testing on this platform where the lid is soldered on, I can't say for sure that there was any significant drop in temps and it made no difference to my overclocking.



Asus P6X58D Premium + LSI 9211 RAID card



The LSI 9211 can give a nice improvement for SSDs, even without raid the card will outperform the Marvel controller by 20% in maximum transfer speeds and 30% better access letency (this isn't really noticeable though as the access latency is in nanoseconds)



The only caveats with this config is the boot times are glacial and the card will only work in one of the top two PCIe x16 slots (the bottom slot caused issues for me).



The LSI also has lower access latency and CPU usage.

Update 05/08/2014 - I can only seem to get my LSI 9211 to work in the top slot on both the Asus P6X58D Premium and the Asus Rampage III Extreme



RAID 0 performance



Some interesting results running RAID 0 on the built in controllers.



I ran the same benchmark on the LSI with RAID 0 but for some reason I lost the screen shot. For some reason the LSI controller suffers in small file transfers when set up with a RAID 0 array, The ICH10R and even the Marvell bests the LSI controller in small file transfers. once file sizes go over 32MB though the LSI controller takes the lead by a wide margin, achieving a max transfer speed of around 1GB/s

And this is the original configuration that I abandoned a while ago, its a 6 disk RAID 0 array with OCZ Vertex 3 120GB drives. As you can see, small file transfer performance is awful. The array is also pretty slow, the hardware is capable of around 3GB/s but going from 2 disks to 6 only increases max speed by 300MB/s

X58 24GB RAM limit



As far as I can tell this limit is only for the consumer CPUs (i7s).

Intel ARK lists the i7s as having a 24GB limit but the Xeons are listed as having a 288GB limit.



I can confirm that 48GB (6 x 8GB G.Skill RipjawsX) works on a Rampage III Extreme and the Asus P6X58D Premium.

Total ram is useable during my testing, I used IBT on Windows 8.1 x64 and told it to use 40GB of ram and it happily filled it. Sisoft Sandra was also quite capable of filling it up.

I have not personally noticed any difference with stability with the larger amount of ram with the same overclock.



Memory overclocking



In my own testing, the Xeons cannot overclock the ram without increasing BCLK, this is different from the i7 which allow ram overclocking without bumping BCLK. You must run with your ram at 1333 at stock clocks otherwise no POST.



Also, overclocking memory results in higher temps on the CPU which may limit your CPU overclock. I wouldn't recommend going far beyond 1600mhz, even just a small increase of 150mhz over this bumped my temps by up to 9C. YMMV.



There is another thread on this topic for the i7 4770k, same thing applies here.

There is a nice post over at overclock.net with in-depth comparisons between the X5660 vs newer systems, including a few gaming benchmarks with surprising results.

Is this even news ? Hyperthreading exists since Pentium IV at Intel, since Zen at AMD. The guys at Forbes are very scared about their stocks at Intel. Maybe they'll like some raise before they sell.

Intel has a double problem with 14nm. They can't make their 10nm so they are lying for about 5 years that it's ready next year, next quarter and now, next months. Nobody believes them anymore. Intel 10nm is dead ! It's for Atom and low core lapptop CPU because Intel can't handle bigger dies without power problems and huge yield drops.

And what about 7nm : no news. They say it's working but we have no evidence. It looks again like 10nm.

The big problems Intel has with 14nm is that to keep up with AMD and with their Core architecture, they have to make huge dies of silicon. Those are going to cost a lot and also they may have not so great yields, and also they may have a huge TDP (big consumption). They already announce 127W TDP and Intel is used like AMD to provide lower figures than heavy use that would go around 4/3 of that number. The mainboards have to support it and you need a big cooler. This is not so great. And watch what they're doing : they make a 10 core as their ultimate Desktop CPU vs 16 cores for AMD and Skylake architecture (which is Comet Lake too) is like behind of about 7% on IPC vs AMD. So they don't make anything there against the Ryzen 3950 but would like to sell it at the same price. Mind that the 3950 has also a bunch of more features you only get on Xeon plateform at Intel, like ECC support.

But Forbes is talking about going vs Zen 3... hah ha big laughs. AMD, who didn't lie for some time now, says their first test chip, not the finals on Zen 3, have already around 10% better IPC than Zen 2 and run around 200 to 300 Mhz faster. They eventually say may add a bunch of more cores. That's really very bad news for Comet Lake since it cannot hold against Zen 2.

But the second big problem for Intel is that they built just enough Fabs to cope with 4 core CPU on 14nm. So the result is not only that they have to forget about some Fabs they are converting to 10 or 7nm, but also to make 6/8/10 core CPU that are those they can sell now against AMD, on limited capacity they made for 2/4 cores. It's like they need to sell the same amount or even more CPU with 1/3 the capacity to make them.

TSMC doesn't look to have the same problems for manufacturing and is investing tens of billions in new facilities, while Intel is investing in buying it's stoks to keep their value.

I'm very sad Intel won't keep up with AMD in 2020, 2021 and probably till 2025, because AMD has now full potential to raise their CPU price, and Intel seems not to be willing to drop their.

Very sad for Intel, loosing it's market share and for me to have to pay a lot for my future AMD CPUs to replace all my deprecated Intel PCs. Sorry Intel, I have to keep up with my competitors !"

The real reason is that: Intel has better inter-process and cache latency.  Games don't have completely independent threads. They frequently need to to pass information between them, and they get preempted more causing cache hits.  Clock speed boost is just icing on the cake.

			I did see that the official support page doesn't list this CPU, but if you look, they say NONE of the Asrock Extreme x79 line supports it.

I was 99% certain I already had the latest BIOS version, but checked and discovered that there is a beta version that's more recent, so I updated and... nothing. Same result. Right now I'm wondering if it could have something to do with the vcore setting not being adequate. When I reset cmos with the button on the mobo it reverts to an 'auto' setting for vcore.

Well as long as it runs 4-4.3GHz I'm fine. It's me paying the power bill after all. It's more the extra threads and PCI-e lanes that are more useful to me than the ultimate OC.

If gaming is your concern, you may want to consider clocking to at least 4.5, you would notice a fairly decent gain from 4 or 4.25 and get very close to Ryzen 3700X performance.  But, if you got the chip for the PCIe lanes and intend to use it for non gaming purposes, then yeah, I dont blame you.  I found over 1.3V this thing starts to use a lot more power and generates a lot more heat.  Under 1.3V it runs quite cool considering the OC I have on mine right now."

			I've been browsing around and almost all online retailers are out of stock or require special order.  Even Amazon and Newegg have been out of stock for a while and only third party price gougers at like $800.  There's maybe a couple stores selling it but I still refuse to pay $100 over MSRP



I've never seen such a terrible launch of a processor. Several months since launch, out of stock everywhere.  I would imagine the demand is low with AMD offerings being  much cheaper so I can't understand why no one is selling it.



I'm dumbfounded that Newegg has been out of stock for what seems forever.  Nothing at Microcenter either.



I would have upgraded but I guess Intel is panicked and worried about bringing out something better to beat AMD.



I guess I'll see what 10900K is like but I really didn't want to get a new Mobo.  I'm very disappointed in Intel since the upgrade path has been garbage.  I'm regretting getting x299 since the 9 series sucked and now the 10 series can't be seen anywhere.

			I'm well aware of how 'most people roll here'... i've been on/around this forum since probably 2004 or so... took a hiatus from caring about pc hardware for about 10 years and welp, here i am.

Anyways you said it in your last paragraph... I mentioned a few times that I'm not talking about max settings... and that everything I throw at my machine runs 'fine' at med-high settings. Clearly we have a divide in our opinions on what actually matters. If I can play the game and it looks alright, that's fine with me. I'm not looking at frame-rates or shadow quality or any of that. I've had $2500 builds, it's just not worth it to me anymore. I don't think you really read or understood what I was saying... of course there are good reasons to get high end stuff if you want the best gaming experience...



All I meant to say is that these days, things will run a lot smoother on just about anything you can buy new (hardware wise), a lot better than it used to in the past, in my opinion. If my dead grandmother's dell can run a new game without any lag... that's sayin' something

Yes, you mentioned not caring about maxed settings. I absolutely understood what you were saying. That's not the part that I was responding to primarily. I will agree that you get more for your money than you used to in some respects. Video cards being one of them.

			Idk, I run my 2 monitors at 2560x1440 and don't have any issues and my specs are pretty basic... 8th gen intel i5 (don't remember clock speed), 16gb ram, low-end graphics card. I'm tellin ya, I think many people are just used to the way things used to be and simply haven't really tried ""lower end"" components because why would they. It is very very very seldom that anything really even gets my basic machine breathing heavy.

			You still need high end hardware to achieve a decent experience beyond 1920x1080. 1920x1080 is a relatively low resolution, but it's also somewhat CPU limited.



I cover this topic in several of my CPU reviews.

Now, you literally said that you weren't sure if you agreed with the statement I made above. You stated you were running dual monitors at 2560x1440, and that you didn't have any issues, etc. I specifically used an example at that precise resolution with a 2700X and Destiny 2 where a 980 Ti barely gets it done at maximum settings. Sure, at medium it would be fine, but again everyone isn't you. 



You then go on to talk about how it's fine and that many people are used to the way things used to be and haven't tried lower end hardware. This is incorrect. I test hardware professionally. This includes lower end hardware. Granted, I don't go super low end on video cards, but I don't need to. I've seen plenty of cases where a medium to high end graphics card may struggle at even lower resolutions in certain games and situations. I have tested lower end processors and have plenty of data to show where they excel and where they falter compared to higher end CPU's. I've written about half a dozen CPU reviews since the middle of last year. This involved a great deal of testing on processors of varying price points, core counts and clock speeds for each article. 



I was simply responding to your assertion that people like myself hadn't tried lower end hardware. This assertion implies that the higher end hardware isn't as necessary as the data and our experiences suggest. This is what I refuted. I don't think doing so is elitist at all. I recognize and talk about the different priorities of different gamers and brought that up. Your good with medium settings, but this is an enthusiast forum where people are wanting to push extremely high refresh rates or higher resolution displays and various configurations in between. Again, this sort of goes against your earlier statement as lower end hardware simply can't always get the job done. In your case, it seems to be doing just fine. I pointed out that it wouldn't work for me, or many other people here.

It may not necessarily be a lack of sensitivity as much as a lack of exposure. Late last year, my girlfriend sat down and played Destiny 2 on my machine using a 120Hz, IPS, G-Sync monitor and a 9900K @ 5.0GHz with DDR4000MHz RAM and an overclocked RTX 2080 Ti. She was used to playing on a 60Hz, 2560x1600 display that is very slow in terms of latency by modern standards. She's used that monitor for years and never complained, so I never upgraded. When she sat down to game on my machine, she could tell the difference between my rig and hers right away, but she couldn't articulate what the difference was. But she noticed her shots were more accurate, she felt faster, etc. 



Long story short, she wanted a faster monitor for Christmas. That's what she got and she noticed the difference immediately.

			Wrong. They have lower IPC than AMD in most workloads, or else they'd be dominating AMD. Only thing keeping them relevant is clockspeeds which leads to them using stupid amounts of power to do the same or slower work than AMD currently.



OP, if you want to tinker AMD will be more fun and use a lot less power. Besides why reward Intel who cheats on security for speed and wanted to keep us on quad cores for the next few decades..
		
		Click to expand...
	
AMD does have higher IPC in its Ryzen 3000 series. Intel only maintains a small single-threaded lead largely because of clock speeds. There are cases where other factors in the architecture may be coming into play, but generally, its clock speed more than anything. Intel's power efficiency is also outright pathetic as I've pointed out. 



I will disagree about the fun of tuning. I don't actually enjoy tuning AMD systems. Once you get your RAM dialed in, it largely feels pointless. Various tuning methods provide good gains in certain cases, but I've never felt like they did anything for me on the gaming front. PB2 is essentially all you need with those chips outside of very specific workloads. I can point out several where a lower single-core, but higher all core clock is warranted. Cinebench R20 showcases this nicely. It's not a real application, but it showcases that principle. The most fun I've had overclocking lately was with Intel's Core i9 10980XE. You get massive clock speed gains and actual results worth talking about. The CPU is far from impressive in its default state. But overclock it, and its a monster with few CPU's that are genuinely faster than it is. At least, in the HEDT market. All of which are considerably more expensive than it is.

You generalize a lot I've noticed. Here is the thing, the masses are more familiar with Intel and that's all brand recognition. In enthusiast circles, people are going AMD because you either get more overall performance or better bang for your buck, or both. It's that simple.

Intel's brought it on themselves. They've allowed their product line to stagnate for almost a decade. We've seen minute improvements in IPC and significant ones in performance per watt in mobile and server markets while desktop CPU's were largely ignored until AMD came around to kick Intel in its apathetic ass. Intel has also been making erroneous claims about IPC improvements from generation to generation while retarding clock speeds nearly every time there is a gain. Intel has manufacturing shortages and problems competing due to process issues etc. On top of that, building an Intel PC right now wouldn't make much sense given that socket LGA 1151 and Z390 are at the end of their life cycle. Late Q1 or early Q2, we should see the 10900K chips using socket LGA 1200. Not that anyone will be able to buy them, but that's not the point. 



We've got plenty of hard core fan boys in either camp here at the [H]. However, most of us are enthusiasts first. We want the best processor for the money, and right now that's generally not Intel."

What tests are you failing exactly?  You have an awfully low Vcore in that screenshot @ 4.4Ghz..Don't be afraid to feed these chips voltage, anything up to 1.45V is fine, although I doubt you would need more then 1.4V to reach 4.5Ghz..Many people will feed them 1.5V+, although I wouldn't recommend that on air, as your one core is already pushing close to 80C..The ""Westmere"" cores in these CPU's are built on the same process as Sandy Bridge, and we all know how much SB loves Voltage..There are guys that have been running extreme 5Ghz+ O/C's on the 2500/2600K's since launch day, what 3~3.5 years ago?



Are you running 3 X4GB of ram? Or 6x2GB? If it is the latter, your IMC likely needs more voltage, even running the ram @ 1600Mhz.

What? IBT is fine, as long as you test it properly.  You need to run it on ""Xtreme Mode"" with all available ram.  The best way to test with it is to launch the program, and then open task manager and lock the core affinity to the physical cores, in the OP's case Cores 0,1,2,8,9, and 10. 



There is nothing wrong with using Prime95 either.  It uses all available threads and uses the maximum amount of power of all the stres tests, thus producing the most amount of heat which is key to determining if your O/C is stable."

B350 was the old gen, B450 is current gen, and B550 is coming later this year.

Still love this platform. Decided to step up again with a 1680 v2 after discovering this whole thing recently (from this and other threads talking about this Xeon), and wanted to join the club. Bought a used one off 'the bay' and dropped it in, but no joy. Nothing comes on. Well, the CPU and case fans come on, but nothing shows up on my screen. The graphics card (GTX 970) fans spin up but go back off when I power on, so I guess it's maaaaybe possible the thing is booting but just the graphics card isn't coming on so I don't see anything? Really doubting that's the case, though and I'm not aware of a simple way to check...





Anyway was wondering if anyone had any ideas what may be going on here. I put the 4930k back in just to check and it still boots (I'm on it right now). It has nothing to do with any cables coming undone or anything like that, I made sure to unplug nothing (and again the 4930k works after just putting it back in). I also made sure to reset CMOS before trying the xeon chip. I'm wondering if the chip just isn't compatible with, or if some other component is just causing an issue somehow. Here's what I have:

Only cost $220 after knocking the seller down a little bit.  Hoping being ""J"" batch I can get 4.6 ~4.8Ghz (if not more!) out of it with 1.4V or less!  Not sure how much it may help overall, but I figure 20% more cores might help me milk this system 6 more months or so until Ryzen 4000.  Plus, if I get a better overclocker than my 5930k, might be worth it some.  The 6950x's were just waayyyyy too expensive and were shit overclockers.  Otherwise, I'd have picked up one of those.  Even $220 for an old CPU seemed high, but compared to all other listings, I think I made out good if it turns out nice.



The risk... I could lose the silicon lottery and get a worse overclock than on my 5930k.  In that case, I'd just resell it on ebay and probably make some money...  lol.  But it takes freaking 1.38V to maintain my current overclock on my 5930k and I have to use the crappy 125Mhz strap as I am unable to hit 3200Mhz memory speeds.  So hopefully, I luck out on the IMC too.



Figure, I love tweaking shit, and snagging a known good overclocker batch of a CPU seemed like a fun way to hopefully milk x99 slightly longer.

			What tests are you failing exactly?  You have an awfully low Vcore in that screenshot @ 4.4Ghz..Don't be afraid to feed these chips voltage, anything up to 1.45V is fine, although I doubt you would need more then 1.4V to reach 4.5Ghz..Many people will feed them 1.5V+, although I wouldn't recommend that on air, as your one core is already pushing close to 80C..The ""Westmere"" cores in these CPU's are built on the same process as Sandy Bridge, and we all know how much SB loves Voltage..There are guys that have been running extreme 5Ghz+ O/C's on the 2500/2600K's since launch day, what 3~3.5 years ago?



Are you running 3 X4GB of ram? Or 6x2GB? If it is the latter, your IMC likely needs more voltage, even running the ram @ 1600Mhz.









What? IBT is fine, as long as you test it properly.  You need to run it on ""Xtreme Mode"" with all available ram.  The best way to test with it is to launch the program, and then open task manager and lock the core affinity to the physical cores, in the OP's case Cores 0,1,2,8,9, and 10. 



There is nothing wrong with using Prime95 either.  It uses all available threads and uses the maximum amount of power of all the stres tests, thus producing the most amount of heat which is key to determining if your O/C is stable.

4.2 at 1.28 volts is below average, so it looks like you lost the silicon lottery in this case. My chips are not anything special either sadly. 5820k needs 1.30 for stability at 4.4, while the 5960x needs 1.24v for stability at 4.3.

Edit#2 Everyone be aware of how easy it is to bend pins on the motherboard if its done in a rush or not placed down on the side when doing the swap. Bent pins will rune your board and cause you to have a really bad day. Take your time and be careful and or you could be shopping for a new board before you even get started.



Wanted to start a new thread dedicated to using x58 1366 platform and using the popular used xeon 6 core cpu's going around everywhere ...back in the day we paid over 300 dollars for 920 cpus but now a days were flying with 44000mhz 6 core cpus sometimes at prices under 100 bucks a pop. Thats an unbelievable price per performance in my opinion



The last thread i started has over 65000 views and takes quite a wile to read threw. Anybody still running a socket 1366 motherboard might be better off just throwing in a hexa core cpu and overclocking it versus spending several hundred dollars upgrading the hole thing system....some of us love making the most of what we have...cause thats all we have.

This thread is not  to brag about how bad ass our system is, but rather share info helping each other getting the most for there money...and get there systems running best as possible with least amount of money spent.



Thees still lots of people unaware there x58 system STILL has plenty of performance and yeas ahead of it....I be willing to bet our systems still overpower amd and or intel setups 5-6 years newer...i could be wrong but i think the benchmarks could prove it....

I'm hoping to get lots of people posting there success stories or problems with as many  screen shots as possible proving stability/ performance  for our sometimes 6 year old systems .....This is my day day out clocks....it just works

What follows is what I've discovered over the last few weeks



Recently I lost my job (covid!), I'm a reasonably heavy user in terms of time on my computer, and I looked at how I could save on power on my desktop.



I've got a 9900k, per my sig. It is not known as the most power efficient/frugal cpu in the world, I never bought it for that reason. What I didn't realise is that when it isn't working hard, it can be extremely efficient.



The first thing I did was go into the bios and enabled speedshift, explicitly enabled all possible c-states (C10 and below) and set a negative offset for the processor voltage.



The second thing I did was learn a bit about Speedshift, and how it and Hardware Duty Cycling worked/what they are.



I looked for ways of checking that these were enabled (they weren’t) and then ways of enabling them.



I found that I could change the power plan variables manually to enable them, but this was fiddly and tedious.



Then I discovered Quick CPU. QuickCPU is a basic, open source piece of software that allows you to modify settings in your windows power plan, monitor use of the processor, and alter nearly every power setting the processor has.



I set up my plan specific to my needs of the computer, and have not noticed any slow-downs, hitching, stuttering or other ill effects in what I do.



Now this does not mean I'll ace benchmarks with the machine, but it'll still be within a few percent of the top speeds, while being a lot more frugal on power.



Specifically how I set my computer up is as below, most of the options are defaults.

I have a L5639 in an Asus Rampage III Extreme, and even though it's overclocked slightly, none of my games have gotten close to maxing out the CPU. I'll need to upgrade my graphics beyond a single HD 7950 before it'll break a sweat.

It has been a long time since video cards were CPU bound, you'd have to go back to games like Half-Life 2 or possibly even Quake 3 Arena.



I'm playing Watch Dogs at the moment and my CPU doesn't even run at its highest possible clock half the time I'm playing. It is heavily threaded but again, it's only using about 40% of my cores.



The only game I play that it CPU bound at the moment is Shift 2, but that is only because the video card is not at 100% and Shift 2 isn't threaded so I see one core at 100% all the time."

I upgraded from an i5-750 to the L5639. When I played BF4 on the i5-750 @4.2GHz, I was pegged at 100% CPU on all 4 cores while my GPU utilization fluctuated around 70%. With the stock L5639, I'm only seeing 33% CPU utilization and 100% GPU.

How the mighty has fallen when Intel was in the lead for a decade.



Not sure why they are asking so much for their Z490 boards, it looks like a refreshed Z390 with a different socket without PCI-E 4.0. Even if the 10900K does manage to outperform the 3900x, they have no answer to the 3950x which is already a loss for Intel there.

rumor mill is that z490 is secretly designed to support PCIE 4.0 when/if intel ever add's it. that was ultimately the reason why they switched to the 1200pin socket even though they don't want to directly confirm it that's what most board partner sources have told GN Steve and der8auer. so if that's the case it would explain the higher prices."

Not really worth it IMO, so I switched to the 125Mhz strap so I could run my DDR4 around 2800Mhz again (instead of 2400Mhz at 100 strap) and backed off 4.7Ghz slightly until I got 4.66Ghz (126.1 BLCK x 37 Mult).

With the adaptive voltage, that configuration was getting me 26C idle and 65C full load.  But, I wanted it push it further to get my DDR4 up to speed.

Intel mainstream is staying on 14nm until  2022.  It's going to peak at 10 cores, then walk backwards with Rocket Lake (8 cores, Willow Cove back-port).





https://www.techpowerup.com/review/future-hardware-releases/#rocketlake



What makes this thrown-together architecture even messier is that we have no idea how many of the efficiency improvements from 10nm will get erased with this rushed back-port to 14nm (obviously this was supposed to be a 10nm part).  We will have to wait and see how high they can clock this potential power-hog!



AMD Zen 3 is expected to give you enough performance to surpass 10-pcore Skylake,! If that's not enough,  then you can wait a year AM5.  But either way, AMD has a lot more interesting-looking consumer platform over the next two years.



Intel is looking to charge a premium of nearly $600  for the 10-core i9-10900K , while AMD is unlikely to do any price increases with Zen 3 (and you can pick-up the 3900X right now for a little over $400, so it's a complete ripoff for 7% higher turbo clocks than the 9900K)."

Why not something with the same gaming ability with even MORE productivity.  It would be an attractive option over simply 15% better gaming.



What will be interesting is if Intel implements an AMD-like precicion boost into their new 8-core.  Even with great cooling, it is hard to imagine the 8-cores going much over 4.5 ghz due to thermals.

(As I've come to understand it) The T and S parts have lower TDP (and clock speed / multiplier) versus the regular parts.



K = unlocked multiplier for balls to the wall performance

() = mainstream non unlocked but still relatively high turbo multiplier

S = Slightly lower clocks but still optimized for performance

T = Significantly lower base clocks and lower TDP, prioritizes power saving over performance.



Underneath it all they're all the same chips.



So with that T part you've got a 3.1ghz (31x) base multiplier versus the 3.6ghz (36x) base multiplier.   The T part also has a 'TDP Down' mode where it could lock the base multiplier down even further to 21x to lower the TDP.

			The Gigabyte ultra board I swear by, it's a nice piece of kit.



I have a NH-D15 on my 9900k.  Recently I've spent a lot of time looking into cooling options cause I am overclocking (5ghz, no avx offset) and I have hacked my case to try and make it quieter. I've even gone so far as to look at custom cooling and various exotic thermal pastes. Currently actual full load rendering temps are high 70s with 18C ambient. I've had to undervolt to make that happen. I recommend an undervolt even if you're not changing clock speed. I am not prepared to go with high 80s-mid 90s for general temps under load.



I would definitely make sure there is plenty of case airflow if you're going with a D15 or equivalent, modifying my (albeit cheap) case for airflow meant 15C degree drops in temperature. I am looking at replacing the case soon with something higher end and quieter. Currently looking at the Fractal design define S2 and R6, leaning towards the former for layout, but the latter has extra side sound dampening and the case sits behind a desk so windows are pointless for me.



If you are definitely not going to overclock or only shooting for a small overclock and want an AIO, then a 280mm based cooler would be fine, I'd recommend Corsair or NXZT as they have long warranties (5 & 6 years respectively) - I would not go a 2y warranty unit such as an arctic or thermaltake.



If you are planning a moderate overclock, I'd definitely consider a 360mm unit. Alphacool have a 420mm unit but the 2 year warranty worries me.



My chip can probably do 5.1/5.2ghz without too much drama, but I don't have the cooling in my case to do it. Heat output goes up substantially every 100mhz from 4.7ghz with AVX, stock AVX under all core load is 4.4ghz. The majority of chips will do 5.0ghz all cores, some will go above, you may be able to hit higher (eg 5.3/5.4) with sufficient cooling.



The KF chips tend to overclock more than the K chips, but I have learned from experience it is always useful to have a backup graphics port.

Only going to be gaming, so not too worried about all-core heat loads as much (I'm working on a final 3950 vs threadripper build for my workstation for that).  Thanks!



edit:  Damn, they're getting hot if stock puts you at 80c under load."

It will overclock better as well. However, as others have stated the clock speed increases may not net you a whole lot in the realm of gains in games. The 7xxx series used a shitty TIM rather than a soldiered IHS. These chips want to clock higher than they do, but keeping them cool is another matter entirely. I haven't tested a 10900X specifically, but the higher core count parts can perform, but overclocking is mandatory to do so. I tested the 10980XE against the 3950X and found the former faster more often than not. However, the heat and power consumption are unreal. I'm actually doing a follow up on the 10980XE now that I've had more time to overclock it and Intel's updated the microcode to allow for better overclocking. In any event, these things will clock, but unless your on a really good custom loop, I wouldn't bother. You woulnd't believe what it takes to really tame these CPU's even in the realm of water cooling. 



Using a 480mm rad and a EKWB Velocity water block, I can hit 107c on some cores running Gooseberry, or the plain Blender Benchmark. That's 4.8GHz on all cores at 1.25v. It trounces the 3950X in most cases at those speeds, but its more expensive, its much harder to cool and it pulls as much power as many complete systems do. Frankly, you need both clocks and at least two extra cores to compete with AMD's offerings. That's where Intel is at right now. 



As far as I am concerned, all of the Cascade Lake-X family is DOA outside of the 10980XE and possibly the 10940X. Everything else is a waste of money in most cases. The only reason to buy a LGA 2066 CPU of any kind right now is if you already have an X299 system. At that point, you'll get off cheaper than buying a 3950X and a top end X570 motherboard. You also really have to have a need for the extra PCIe lanes and memory bandwidth. If all the check boxes are met, then a Cascade Lake-X CPU might be a really good fit for you. But honestly, I'd wait until Intel's new CPU's launch and see what its new mainstream platform has to offer. I would also suggest waiting until we know what AMD's got in the works for the 4000 series Ryzen's. At that point, you can go either direction, or pick up a Ryzen 3000 series CPU at a healthy discount."

If you can get a 9900k with a gigabyte z390 aorus (ideally Ultra, if not pro Wifi) for equal to or less than the price of the equivalent 10700 with motherboard, I'd get that, otherwise I would go 10700. I wouldn't worry about the 10900k for gaming, the difference will be marginal at best.



Note the 9900k is vicious and requires some special attention for cooling.

			Here is the non AVX vf curve for the ES chip. the 94 quality one (this is in top 10%, high A tier).



The red line is the predicted VR VOUT value at 100C needed for non AVX prime95 small FFT (100C means, as if Thermal Velocity Boost Voltage Optimizations are disabled--this setting being enabled reduces the vCPU 1.55mv every 1C starting at 100C



TVB Voltage optimizations have been here since Kaby Lake.  This isn't anything new.



""vCPU"" is CPU VID when AC Loadline and DC Loadline are both at 0.01 mOhms. 



The blue line is the predicted Bios setting at loadline calibration level 4, that Asus guesses that you need for that VR OUT.



If your CPU can do a lower VR OUT than the red line predicts (if it is at 100C), then there is a guardband of voltage leeway.

In my case, for example, at 5.2 ghz, I can do AVX small FFT disabled Prime95 with a load VOUT of 1.235v, at 90C (200 amps), while the red prediction says I need 100C.



For 5.3 ghz, I have no cooling headroom to test that.  But Battlefield 5 and Minecraft (Java, loading to main menu loop test) seems to need about 1.325v load, although AIDA64 Stress FPU needs less.  This might be due to violent transients that BF5 and Minecraft loading causes.  Notice the prediction says I need about 1.356v.

Some of them go extremely in depth so don't be intimidated if shooting for a mild OC.



Even before your upgrade your cooling you may want to play with your vcore settings. Some boards auto detect way too high. Force a manual target and test for stability \ temps. Keep testing and adjust down or up as needed. (I typically start at the auto vcore voltage and work my way down) Once you find a sweet spot you can start playing with your multiplier and increase vcore as needed. If you find you are still throttling even at the lowest possible vcore then you will need a cooling upgrade for sure. 



Like I said previously 4-4.2ghz should be as simple as setting the multi to 40-42 and vcore to somewhere between 1.2 and 1.3. 4.5ghz+ should be obtainable if you really want to dive into it.



Most cheap AIO coolers only come with one fan, you may be able to improve temps a bit by adding another fan to the other side for a push \ pull setup."

Why would changing the CPU break the 3ds max license? Even if it did, you can just use the LTU - License Transfer Utility to deactivate on the machine before the CPU change and then use it again to re-activate it after the CPU change.

Thank you.  I don't know for *sure* that changing the CPU will break my license. I can't get an answer from Autodesk other than it *may* and they state that a hardware change ""might"" cause the license to fail.

Yes the LTU is what I am thinking of doing but there is a problem. I have current version and also old version 2016.  I believe the LTU will require reactivation and they are no longer activating v 2016 which I need.  So if I break that license I also lose access to plugins I have paid for that only work on 2016.  Autodesk is killing all perpetual licenses and also killing all activations so perpetual license users will soon not be able to activate their software in the event of switching to a new computer or a hardware change or OS change or if it decides to try to ping the server randomly due to time.

So I'm basically stuck on this old 2013 PC because I cannot transfer or install 2016 to another machine.  My hope is upgrading the CPU of the machine so it works a little better but then it still may break the license.

I have one small thing to help me -  I have a clone of my system drive. So if I change the CPU and it breaks all my licenses I think I could change the CPU back to the old one and swap back in the clone system drive and be back as I was before I tried the upgrade....maybe.  So that way I could attempt the risk without ruining everything if it didn't work."

Do you have the actual model of your laptop's GPU and CPU? While it may have something to do with the NVME I suspect it also has a lot to do with a ~6 generation newer CPU and ~ 3 generation newer GPU. I'm sure it's more than enough to negate whatever clock speed advantage your desktop currently has.



Overclocking if done safely should net you decent gains without risking you cpu longevity. Just make sure you keep your voltages reasonable (under 1.5vcore iirc). 4-4.2ghz should be as simple as setting the multi to 40-42 and vcore to somewhere between 1.2 and 1.3. 4.5ghz+ should be obtainable if you really want to dive into it."

I'm not opposed to AMD, and have built a few systems with AMD chips in the past (am2 era)... Like now, I think it really just depends on the current state of the market that dictates which way I swing with cpu. I think as of recently it's the first time in a long time that it is actually a better choice to go with AMD... if what everybody is saying is true. 



I may be the minority here, but I don't really care about clock speeds and spending an extra $200 for a few more fps. I play games but I've noticed something strange lately. I've been gaming on a HP pavillion I got for ~$300 used. It's got an 8th gen intel i5 and a 2GB GTX-something (don't even know) and it can handle just about every game I own and throw at it (and I buy new games all the time)... maybe not at max/ultra, but it can play everything and look pretty damn good while doing it. I don't remember this being the case years ago- where you actually needed high end gamer stuff to play pc games. I even play the witcher 3 on med/high.



I think what's happened is that hardware has advanced faster than gaming/graphics/whatever and is finally reaching a place where basic hardware that comes in stock branded desktops can handle games pretty well- especially the older games like dark souls and stuff like that... so I feel like super high end pc components is more of a niche hobby now more than ever, in that you don't really NEED the most expensive stuff to play games. 



I'm a developer and a passionate tinkerer who plays some games (mostly mtg arena), so I do enjoy some speed, but I think splurging on the most expensive stuff is mostly for bragging rights these days (not that it hasn't always been). I just want something decent to code on and do what I do... I usually find that spending ~$13-1500 on a build is a sweet spot for me. 



Thanks for all the suggestions everyone."

75% is a little extreme.  50% is more realistic depending on which chip you buy.  A 2600 for example was $199 and now is usually $99 on a super sale or $119 normal pricing.  The 2700X was $329 and is now ~$159.  2700 was $299 and is $149.  All of which represent fantastic bang for the buck.



1st gen Ryzen might be around 75% (or more seeing as the 1800x was a $499 launch price part).  But I would have a hard time recommending them since the 2XXX series has much better memory compatibility."

It's not hard. It's become so mainstream, the hardest part is making up your mind between all the options. Lol. Starting from scratch is expensive, but long term, if money is a concern as it is to me, most parts are transferable. Cpu blocks, pumps, radiators, reservoirs and fittings can be used build after build. I used the same pump for well over 10 years on my main pc. 



Gpu blocks are the odd ball. If you are looking top end, it's pricey, and blocks often devalue cards. 



You won't get significantly better clocks or temps on the cpu anymore though. A good aio is going to match it. The gpu though will love it, and silent gaming is quite wonderful."

I checked it with Coretemp and it says I'm running at 3501MHz, and working with a 4K sequence in Premiere Pro the CPU core loads were around 70-100%, mostly between 80-100. The temps of the cores got into the 85-90 degrees C after only a few minutes.



Doing a v-ray render in 3ds Max all cores mostly stay at 100% and the temps climbed to upper 80 degrees and mostly stayed there, but even hit 90 and 91 C occassionally on all 6 cores, and they all changed orange and stayed orange(?)

It seems the temps change orange once they hit about 85 for a little while and change back to black once they drop into low 80s high 70s (or less).



I also noticed that the Frequency fluctuates between about 2900MHz to about 3500MHz during 100% render load.  But when the load is low the frequency stays consistant 3501.57MHz.  Is that normal?



So it looks like my cooler isn't enough already?  And my CPU is struggling too?"

			yea the benefit aren't too great but imo 8 core with HT turned off with more cache should perform higher than 6c/12t. threading only gives 10-20% in some cases, where as 33% more cores always gonna be there along with more cache.

Having spent a nontrivial amount of my life researching and developing SMT - I would just reiterate that you should run benches to validate assumptions. Things are often quite counter-intuitive.



Cache with relation to the cores is very tricky. Cache population is quite good in modern processors. It turns out ""more cache"" rarely has much of an impact in most programs (emphasis on most - there are some things which are all over the place with memory locality), because the access patterns which blow up the 'smaller' cache still blows up the larger.



Constrast this with having another thread on the core - you avoid stalling the entire core based upon 1 cache miss or similar stall. This is why SMT ends up giving really solid improvements, even though you'd think the cores should be fully utilized by aggressive workloads. Stalls are very expensive.



So if the desire is to have more cache versus more threads, consider that the bargain really boils down to slightly increasing your cache hit rate at the cost of significantly increasing the cost of a cache miss.



If power/heat is a huge concern, I'm not going to have any good advice. Trying to optimize throughput while saying power is the primary constraint is not a world I've had to live in. Well, I guess my advice would still be ""Get more cooling!"""

			The problem with this new socket is it's a guaranteed dead-end:



In the typical one refresh per-platform the 10-core Skylake will be replaced by an 8-core Icelake.  Icelake is currently clocking at around 4GHz max boost!



Even if they resolve some of the issues in getting clocks higher, the best you can expect in Icelake refresh is 4.5 GHz.



AMD is expected to do better with Zen 3 later on this year (15% higher IPC, should be faster per-core than the massively-overclocked 10900K) , but you might want to wait for Socket AM5 (next year) . 



Intel mainstream platforms are not the way to go if you want better per-core performance.  Unless 20% is good enough for you (that's as high as the platform will go)?  They're so heavily-overclocked, they're expected to use the same power as your current E-series processor.

Why do you say it's a guaranteed dead socket? Don't you think you'd get a couple CPU upgrades out of it or do you think Intel will jump to DDR5 shortly after?  The problem with Zen 3 this year is it's the last AM4 cpu before going to AM5 so if I skip 10900x I might as well skip Zen3 since I won't have any upgrade path without getting a new Mobo and RAM for AM5."

I've never seen such a terrible launch of a processor. Several months since launch, out of stock everywhere.  I would imagine the demand is low with AMD offerings being  much cheaper so I can't understand why no one is selling it.



I'm dumbfounded that Newegg has been out of stock for what seems forever.  Nothing at Microcenter either.

I was just reading that it is best to have twice the amount of system RAM as you have dedicated VRAM.  With my 4 GB memorey and 8 GB memory I would have 12 GB system RAM and the 6 GB VRAM on the video card, which is about a perfect ratio.  With a 1060 6GB GPU I do not need any system RAM being put towards VRAM.  



Hell with ""my"" usage of ""this"" computer I really don't even need the 3 GB of system RAM that it is currently allocating to VRAM as the 1GB on my AMD GPU is enough to take care of anything I am doing at the moment.  On past computers I was able to adjust the size of or even turn off VRAM being allocated from system RAM, but this BIOS has almost no settings in it.



If I was using the onboard GPU built into the CPU then I would need VRAM allocated to it from RAM, but as I will never be using the Intel GPU built in into the CPU and my new video card will have 6GB of VRAM on it, I see no reason to even allocate RAM to VRAM.



As for memory usage I have had no issues or problems with it as yet.  I thought I would set this particular tower up with the capability of being able to continue to play some of the newer more graphically intensive games over the next few years.  My kids are always trying to get me play games with them and my four old towers are getting tough to keep upgraded enough to hang on to any of the newer games, so I thought I would go ahead and upgrade a bit as my main tower that I use is now 12 years old.  ""My"" computers might be used for medium to low core gaming about 1% of the time, so it isn't a great issue, I just like to be able to set things up the way I want and I am finding to my chagrin that I seem to have no control over this anymore unlike all of my past computer builds."

This doesn't mean it can't be done with a soldered BGA processor, but it definitely is a lot more complicated.  If you look at the list of processors for BGA1364, you can see that some of the later ones come with 128MB of Lvl. 4 cache.

			You should be fine.  There are no current games that play below 50fps on a 4790k; most of them still play around 100 fps.  You will usually be limited by by  your video card (especially if you play with RTX on at native res).



But I'm not sure you will ever run into this problem -  7nm EUV is a cutting-edge process node, so they may delay introduction of the Ti version.  You will porobably have to wait until next spring for that release, and by that time you will have Zen 3.



I see no reason you can't run the LG on HDMI 2.0  4:2:0 at 120 hz for games, and 60hz 8-bit for browsing the internet/video.  I ran my LG C7 on my old HTPC's GTX 750  Ti at 4:2:0 60hz (older games at 1080p high, newer games at 720p high), until I could upgrade my GTX 960 in my main rig and make use of that (it plays older games just fine at 4k 60, and newer RPG games at 1080p med/high).



But with only the GTX 1080 Ti, you will be more GPU-limited at 4k.

Interesting perspective, I just assumed NVDA would start with Ti model before introducing lower end.

Here is the non AVX vf curve for the ES chip. the 94 quality one (this is in top 10%, high A tier).



The red line is the predicted VR VOUT value at 100C needed for non AVX prime95 small FFT (100C means, as if Thermal Velocity Boost Voltage Optimizations are disabled--this setting being enabled reduces the vCPU 1.55mv every 1C starting at 100C



TVB Voltage optimizations have been here since Kaby Lake.  This isn't anything new.



""vCPU"" is CPU VID when AC Loadline and DC Loadline are both at 0.01 mOhms.  



The blue line is the predicted Bios setting at loadline calibration level 4, that Asus guesses that you need for that VR OUT.



If your CPU can do a lower VR OUT than the red line predicts (if it is at 100C), then there is a guardband of voltage leeway.

In my case, for example, at 5.2 ghz, I can do AVX small FFT disabled Prime95 with a load VOUT of 1.235v, at 90C (200 amps), while the red prediction says I need 100C.



For 5.3 ghz, I have no cooling headroom to test that.  But Battlefield 5 and Minecraft (Java, loading to main menu loop test) seems to need about 1.325v load, although AIDA64 Stress FPU needs less.  This might be due to violent transients that BF5 and Minecraft loading causes.  Notice the prediction says I need about 1.356v.

Intel also says lga1366 desktop processors support up to 24 GB however users have installed 48GB of unbuffered DDR3 and it works. In the case of lga1366 the limit was because during the production of the lga1366 desktop processors 8GB unbuffered dimms did not exist.

		Click to expand...
	
""Eat"" is relative and $100 is $100...  I can't really talk to the motherboard situation, but a cursory look seemed to me like they are basically the same basic design just with Intel chipsets (for example, Asus X570-P vs. Z490-P looked awfully similar and other than a few different ICCs likely are).



I feel no need to upgrade personally to anything this generation (after all it's just another Skylake iteration and I already have one of those) nor do I feel the need to upgrade any Ryzen 3XXX system I have as the gaming is ""good enough"" for the price.  I'm holding out for the Zen 3 vs. Rocket Lake battle later this year (or early next year) which should be much more interesting.



Edit: I just got an e-mail from newegg with $165 Ryzen 3600s.  Couple that with a $65 BNIB B450 and you're at $230.  The 10400 (non-k) with the same 6C/12T is $195.  Boost speed is 4.3Ghz.  Lowest priced Z490 board is $150 on NE.  So at a bare minimum you're at $230 vs $345 for what would be very similar performance.  To get an unlocked i5, you're still looking at $230+ just for the CPU.  If Intel allows OCing on B460 boards, and the ""locked"" CPUs can MCE to max turbo on all core, then the price/performance might be closer.  And I might be tempted to drop $20-30 extra for an Intel chipset as I've always had good luck with them.  I'm not tempted to drop $100 extra at this time."

It currently has an i3-4160 Haswell 3.5 GHz  Dual core 4 thread cpu in it.



Right now it only has 6 GB og RAM in it and it is pulling 3 GB out of that for VRAM added to the 1 GB on my old Radeon GPU.



On Intel's specs page the i3-4160 Haswell 3.5 GHz processor should only be putting 2 GB of Ram toward video memory.  So how am I getting 3GB?



I bought an i5-4670 quad core four thread to replace this processor with along with 8 GB of memory.  The 8 GB added to the 4 will give me 12 GB at the moment until I buy another 8 GB memory stick.  I also bought a GeForce 1060 with 6 GB onboard memory.



The Intel specs page tells me that the i5-4670 also pulls a max of 2GB of RAM for VRAM the same as it says for the current processor which is pulling 3 GB of RAM from (6) installed for VRAM.  As there are no settings in HP's ridiculously underpowered BIOS settings I am curious just how much VRAM the CPU is going pull from my RAM?



I mean 12 GB of VRAM would be a bit much and leave me a mere 6 GB for system memory at the rate I am seeing.  Anyone understand why my current CPU is pulling 3GB instead of the 2GB Intel's specs page lists for it?  



Will the new CPU do the same?



Will increasing the RAM memory increase the amount of VRAM?



Two gigs being pulled from the 12 gigs of RAM and added to the 6 gigs on the 1060 GPU would in itself be a bit ridiculous, but I see no options whatsoever where it comes to VRAM in BIOS settings.  Is there a way to set this via the CPU/GPU itself? 



Is it possible that DXDIAG might be reading the VRAM wrong? Looking at it right now it is reading 3798 GB, my old ATI Juniper XT video card only has 1GB of memory on it so the other 3GB (2798) has to be coming from installed RAM provided DXDIAG is reading this properly.



I will be going ahead and putting Win 10 Pro on this computer next week, it is currently Win 7 Pro, is there any way to set the VRAM through the Win 10 Pro OS?"

Doubtful.



Intel still has a 20% IPC advantage in most games, and since they're matching AMD on core count and clocks in the low-end, and their overclocked 6-core exceeds AMD's 6 and 8-core in most benches, they're in no need of moar coars.



But the 2700x's overclocked speeds put it within 15% of the 8700k in games, which while uncomfortably close is still a win.  But that bump is enough to win in many productivity benchmarks.



But that's what the 8086k is there to combat.  So no, it's a tight battle, but not critical enough to rush out another core rev.



If you need Moar Coars, that's what Threadripper and Skylake-E are for."

I guess another plus is AMD is affordable to people with a lot less money which would mean ... a lot of people. So I am glad kids with a lot less money can at least have AMD in their corner. Also, after doing some research, it turns out that one of the major reasons Intel can out perform AMD at a hight NM process is their CPU tech. Apperently, Intel has 1000's and 1000's of patents pertaining to inside their CPU's, tech that AMD simply does not have. I've been reading that Intel at 10nm will still out perform AMD at 5nm, let alone their 7nm. Brand prediction, data gates, a lot of way over my head crazy stuff that Intel has. This is what give them the ability to overclock, etc. Very interesting stuff if you start digging in and reading.



I am so happy that AMD woke Intel up. This is going to be amazing ride in the coming years for all of us.



I picked up an Intel 10900K today at Microcenter and an Asus z490 ROG Maximus Hero Wifi along with Samsung B-Die 4400Mhz DDR4 memory. Second place has never ever really been something I've ever wanted to settle for. I anticipate having one of the worlds fastest gaming PC's once I am done.



Come to think of it, I think I understand who the 10900K is for, it's for people who are serious about gaming and won't accept anything but the fastest gaming experience you can buy.

That's not correct.  There are users like me who try to go for ""best in class"" components.  Price is still important, but secondary.  That meant that since the AMD Athlon I've been Intel since Intel technology was clearly superior.  And yes, during that time AMD was for people looking to save a buck.



But it's now 2020 and that's no longer the case.  I'm not going to get ""old techology"" 14 nm components cause Intel messed up their manufacturing and is stuck on 14nm. That means the 10900k is out of the question.  I'm going with a modern 7nm CPU from the guys with the better technology.  And I don't care about the price.  Sadly, that means no Intel this time.



I suppose the 10900k is for two groups: ""pure gamers"" looking for the highest clock speed who don't mind CPU's built on older technology and are slightly less capable (as an overall CPU) and have plenty of money.  And people who like Intel because they like the brand."

Worse case is ~25ns, Still a fraction of the AMD inter-CCX penalty which is up to 90ns.

The Intel Xeon E5-2687W v2, and some other Xeons

look really tempting except for the price on the 4960x.



I've never OC'd one before.  The CPU is already 6.5 years old and has done some pretty hard video editing and rendering.  Should I expect OC to bring it to a soon death? How about stability? Will it be likely be crashing my computer if OC?

I should have paid more back then for a better CPU but they were a lot more so I didn't....



And yeah I'm wondering if my better performing notebook is largely due to 8GB Quadro and NVME data drives vs SSD.  System drives are both same type SSD. Notebook has newer i7 but only 2.9GHz.



And then that brings the thought....instead of changing the CPU, change the GPU to an older (but better) GPU instead? That would be easier change...except the GPU has to be old enough to support Adobe CS6 which the new ones often have issues with CUDA and some old ray tracing stuff used back then"

			ok


7nm is not as mature a process as 14+nm
7nm means that the size of the transistors is smaller, therefore they produce less heat but are more densely packed thus more heat is produced in a smaller area which means higher temperatures under load
It also means that it is harder to get heat away from the source.
Higher temperatures are inversely proportionate to speed, the faster you go, the hotter you get, you can’t go as fast if you are hot.
12-16 cores are not necessary for the majority of use cases at this time
12-16 threads is optimal for gaming at the high end of the scale, 8 is sufficient, 12 is very good, 16 is .. probably overkill in general.
8-10 threads is adequate for the majority of games these days (Starcraft 2 uses up to 4 reasonably well, AC:Origins/odyssey use 10-12, Doom eternal uses 14-15 albeit not putting all under load most of the time)
More cores is better for: Video rendering/compression, 3d rendering, compiling software, running benchmarks, deep learning/ai, Microsoft excel
For the vast majority of users these days 6 cores is enough, heck most can get by happily on 4.
Idling on the desktop and web browsing can be done happily on 2 cores or one core with 2 threads
Streaming and gaming can be done with QSV or Nvenc

Thank you.



I guess another plus is AMD is affordable to people with a lot less money which would mean ... a lot of people. So I am glad kids with a lot less money can at least have AMD in their corner. Also, after doing some research, it turns out that one of the major reasons Intel can out perform AMD at a hight NM process is their CPU tech. Apperently, Intel has 1000's and 1000's of patents pertaining to inside their CPU's, tech that AMD simply does not have. I've been reading that Intel at 10nm will still out perform AMD at 5nm, let alone their 7nm. Brand prediction, data gates, a lot of way over my head crazy stuff that Intel has. This is what give them the ability to overclock, etc. Very interesting stuff if you start digging in and reading.



I am so happy that AMD woke Intel up. This is going to be amazing ride in the coming years for all of us.



I picked up an Intel 10900K today at Microcenter and an Asus z490 ROG Maximus Hero Wifi along with Samsung B-Die 4400Mhz DDR4 memory. Second place has never ever really been something I've ever wanted to settle for. I anticipate having one of the worlds fastest gaming PC's once I am done.

			So the framerate doesnt change in games whether youre at stock 4.3, or OC 5.0? Also, were these issues present with your old GPU?



The only time ive seen things like this are with a slightly unstable OC (even RAM would do it too, not sure if you OC that), but I have seen CPUs that will either go from normal usage to 0 - 5%, or run at near full max constantly when under load due to a slight instability. Maybe try dropping clocks on your CPU a bit? Do a 4.8 run or somthing that might be a little more stable?



EDIT - If you do try to lower your CPU clock, dont change ANY othe rsettings. We would want to isolate as many variables as possible.

I've had this system pass 24h Prime at 4.4Ghz (22x200 1.35V) but for some reason my X-Fi Titanium doesn't like it. Haven't had time to continue trying to resolve it, at this point I'm considering upgrading to a newer sound card.



I haven't actually tested the stability of my current overclock (4.03Ghz) because I'm desperate to just play some games (with sound LOL) especially Watch_dogs, I have very limited alone time at the moment and frankly I would rather play games than spend time tweaking.

Which thermal grease do you recommend? I had another crack late last night, a thin layer on the CPU and an even thinner layer on the WB but I know that the middle of the WB is not making any contact with the centre of the CPU because I lapped it (I lapped a Q6600 back in the day with this same WB). I'm going to lap my X5670 since this is going to be the last CPU in this system. I'll do it sometime this week and report back with results.



I'm still fiddling, my new settings are 24x183 BCLK, I'm experimenting with ram overclocking, the G.Skill ram I have seems to be holding up quite well and there was a nice 4GB/s improvement in memory bandwidth.

I'm picking up a new PSU today, wonder if it will make any difference to overclocking, the PSU I'm currently running is still out of spec on the 3.3V, just not as bad as the last one I had. I'm going with a Seasonic Platinum 1000W."

Yes, the mainstream part is definitely better for gaming due to the ring bus (Mainstream) vs mesh (HEDT).

			If it's for gaming you should keep the 7820x for a while. It's just the GPU that will very likely make a change in 2020. You will need to get a high en gaming card, wait for Ampere probably. AMD seems to be doing catch-up only. Will let you run 4K with ray tracing and the CPU may still not matter if it's already 8 cores.

I agree with this.  Your monitor isn't going to leverage the CPU gains as you will be GPU limited anyway.  So no sense in upgrading your CPU for gaming.  You could game on a $100 processor and not see the difference between what you have now at 4K."

With everything on default, excepto for XMP Profile I was able to find the issue. When the Corsair software is running, it uses 5% of cpu, that make believe Windows that the cpu is not in lazy mode, as soon as you exit the soft, PUM, everything works.



I was reading on the net, it does the same on 9900k, but as far as I found, not on all motherboards.

Intel for the last decade has been light on innovation for CPU, and they've been rehashing the same architecture for five years because they tied their new architectures to their failed 10nm node.

1) No.



2) Now is a good time. RAM is cheap, SSD costs have come down, CPU sockets have great upgrade paths.



3) AMD best performance/dollar - Ryzen 5 3600. Intel best performance/dollar - i5-9400F.



4) This is just an overview to get you reacquainted. It's always best to read a few articles and research a little before pulling the trigger.

AM4 is at end of it's life.  It may get the next Zen iteration,  but the one after is almost surely going to be AM5 (or whatever they decide to call it).  Intel is never a good bet for socket longevity.

			Not worth it -  you get 20% higher singlle-thread, 15% higher multi-core.



If you're running a game at 100 fps, that would mean your performance goes up to 120. fps.  Not worth the massive cost of changing platforms.



If you're craving more cores, why not look around for 12 cores Skylake X refresh (used, as new is overpriced)?

I primarily game.  I decided to go HEDT with Skylake X coming from a 4790K to get 8 cores then later intel came out with the 9900k 8 core on the standard desktop line.  

After trying out HEDT and realizing the advantages weren't really there for my use, I'd kinda rather go back to a standard desktop platform now considering they've caught up to 8/10 cores and >5ghz.



If I could get a 20fps increase I would definitely take that considering I'm gaming at 4k / 120hz but in reality at that resolution the graphics card will probably make a bigger impact."

			No one is interested in the latest 10 core, up to 5.3 ghz chip??

Seems pretty interesting. But I haven't seen much hype about it. Is it the same core as the existing Coffee Lake setup, just more of them at a higher clock?

What I am most excited about is the return of the 8700K, now as an i5 at a lower price point, and maybe even the return of the 7700K, as lower priced i3.



You might try delidding and Liquid Metal on that 8700K, if you feel it's holding you back, but really I think you you wouldn't even notice a difference with i9 10900K, over your 8700K, except when the benchmark reports it's number.



Just because something faster exists, doesn't mean it would actually produce a meaningful benefit for you.

Intel's biggest problem with 10nm going forward, is that their 14nm was too damn good. Now 10nm can't really compete on the desktop where clock speed is king.



Even TSMC 7nm would be a downgrade for Intel vs its 14nm on Desktop.  It's possible we might never see another 5GHz+ desktop CPU from anyone, below 14nm."

			Thank you.



Also, after doing some research, it turns out that one of the major reasons Intel can out perform AMD at a hight NM process is their CPU tech. Apperently, Intel has 1000's and 1000's of patents pertaining to inside their CPU's, tech that AMD simply does not have. I've been reading that Intel at 10nm will still out perform AMD at 5nm, let alone their 7nm. Brand prediction, data gates, a lot of way over my head crazy stuff that Intel has. This is what give them the ability to overclock, etc. Very interesting stuff if you start digging in and reading.





Come to think of it, I think I understand who the 10900K is for, it's for people who are serious about gaming and won't accept anything but the fastest gaming experience you can buy.
		
		Click to expand...
	
No, the key reason that intel is “still in the game” is because most software is compiled with their chips in mind first.



The reality is that clock for clock, AMD is faster. Intel’s clock speed advantage is the only thing keeping its narrow lead. Well that and better AVX2 units.



The fastest gaming experience anyone can buy is actually the 9900kf, cause most of the time you can overclock all cores to 5.2-5.3ghz or so if you try hard enough, possibly even 5.4 if you take extreme measures. And 5.1ish is attainable with AVX on too.



The 10900k will clock that high on all cores, but custom cooling is the only way to guarantee its safety."

I made the jump from a Phenom II 945 to the 5820K a year or so ago and haven't seen a need to make another jump.   I multi-task a bunch of lower demand things.  ...email, massive spreadsheets, MS Paint, PDF editors, Google Maps, municipal GIS maps, a half dozen browser pages open, Youtube playing in background, etc, etc.   12 threads at 4+ ghz each made a serious improvement over the 4 core Phenom II.    The only game I play anymore is Diablo 3, and that doesn't slow down this Haswell 6 core at all.



I don't think I've yet to make this 5820K hurt, so I haven't had a need or desire to jump to newer Intel or AMD offerings.  



However, here in the next week or two I'll be ripping(MakeMVK & Handbrake) DVD's and Blueray to a Plex server I'm building(Xeon E5-2667-v2).    I'll be using both, 5820K and Xeon, in the beginning to load up the server with all the media I have on discs.   ....that might fully utilize my 5820K until the server is loaded."

			I'm half debating picking up a 9900k for that reason - can find boards and parts, it's about the same as a 10900k for gaming, and it's cheaper too.  Won't make a difference for a long time, and that would let me pass the 6700 on to the wife.

The 10900k is it's own animal.  Obviously the direct competition is to the 10700k.  Pricewise, the 10700k is cheaper when you can find one (new).  Used is always a tossup depending on availability, etc.



I got a 9900ks for $350, but I already had a compatible motherboard, and it's just a matter of swapping out the CPU.  If I had to buy both CPU/MB new anyway, I'd probably just get the 10700k instead (or maybe even a 10700 for $60 cheaper and override the turbo with a Z490 board.  Not sure I'd ever really notice it being $60 slower).  At least then there would be an upgrade path to Rocket Lake if it ends up being worthwhile."

No, I haven't tried it without the BCLK adjustment, but it is perfectly stable for days on end without QuickCPU running.  I can try it though.

Peak turbo speed is ~4.9Ghz single core, ~4.7Ghz all core.

I'll try it without the hardware duty cycling

Not necessarily isolated to core parking.  That was just a guess.

I never checked the cache downbin, but it looks like it does downclock with CPU load in CPU-Z.



I'll play around with it more.  It's just tough to diagnose because I'm not using the computer actively when it happens.  The only thing I've noticed is that when I'm not running QuickCPU it is perfectly stable, so I'm guessing it's a setting in there.  I just have to enable things one at a time to see if I can isolate it.



Starting a test right now.  Put the core parking index to 100% and am going to see what happens over the next day or so.



Edit:  It locked up again.  So I guess my initial core parking theory is wrong.  Onto another setting!  I'm going to try Hardware Duty Cycling.



Edit2:  Well, Hardware Duty Cycling is the early leader in the clubhouse for causing the freezing/reboots.  I disabled it, and my computer has been running all day with a mixed workload (mostly idle which is where it was rebooting).  Let's see how it looks tomorrow morning."

			Intel mainstream is staying on 14nm until  2022.  It's going to peak at 10 cores, then walk backwards with Rocket Lake (8 cores, Willow Cove back-port).





https://www.techpowerup.com/review/future-hardware-releases/#rocketlake



What makes this thrown-together architecture even messier is that we have no idea how many of the efficiency improvements from 10nm will get erased with this rushed back-port to 14nm (obviously this was supposed to be a 10nm part).  We will have to wait and see how high they can clock this potential power-hog!



AMD Zen 3 is expected to give you enough performance to surpass 10-pcore Skylake,! If that's not enough,  then you can wait a year AM5.  But either way, AMD has a lot more interesting-looking consumer platform over the next two years.



Intel is looking to charge a premium of nearly $600  for the 10-core i9-10900K , while AMD is unlikely to do any price increases with Zen 3 (and you can pick-up the 3900X right now for a little over $400, so it's a complete ripoff for 7% higher turbo clocks than the 9900K).
		
		Click to expand...
	
If Intel charges $600 for a CPU that supposed to compete with a 3900x ($500 retail, can be bought for closer to $400), then they are dead on arrival.  



Also, it makes so sense why Intel would drop back down to 8 cores for Rocket Lake on a mainstream platform when AMD already has 16 cores on 3950x.  Intel is clearly screwed and I'm tired of their non-sense.

I'll likely wait out until next year and go AMD on AM5 since they clearly have a solid product strategy and values what consumers want at a reasonable price point.  Intel can screw themselves.  They are turning out to be as bad as Nvidia at this point."

I'm still fiddling, my new settings are 24x183 BCLK, I'm experimenting with ram overclocking, the G.Skill ram I have seems to be holding up quite well and there was a nice 4GB/s improvement in memory bandwidth.

I'm picking up a new PSU today, wonder if it will make any difference to overclocking, the PSU I'm currently running is still out of spec on the 3.3V, just not as bad as the last one I had. I'm going with a Seasonic Platinum 1000W.

However, I noticed that my cpu usage is nearly maxed out when OC'd at 5ghz versus stock levels.



In BFV CPU usage is in the 90 to 98% usage bracket when OC'D to 5ghz@1440p



But at stock (4.3ghz all cores), usage dips to an average of around 70%@1440p

Same applies for all other intense games - Scum, Hell Let Loose, etc..





Is this normal? I would assume with higher frequencies that usage would go down, not up.



Doesnt make sense.

Is the OC confirmed stable? Does the framerate change?"

			Thanks for sharing.  I was actually looking at these online again about an hour ago.   Trying to determine how to make a good choice since they are all used CPUs. I will have to remove my motherboard (uhhgh!) to change cooler and CPU since there isn't access to the backplate.  That is really making me question doing the upgrade since it won't be a major performance boost....but I still am wanting to

I’m not sure you can make a good choice- they’re all used and all from servers, but at least on that point they were $2k CPUs, so odds are they were well cared for and in a temp controlled environment run at stock for their entire service lives. They’re high binned chips as well, so you also have that going for you as well. It’s not much money, and it could be a decent upgrade. For me at least, this’ll keep me going at least another year."

if you mean outright performance, sure it's the best.. if you mean the best 360 aio to own? fk no, that thing is a loud pos. it's performance is purely because it brute forces it's way to those numbers since there's nothing else to make it stand out over the other 5-10 standard asetek 360 AIO model's that are on the market. after you change the fans you're looking at a 130-140 dollar cooler which already makes it more expensive then a arctic freezer II 360mm that is better than it in every way.

			To be honest, Intel has all but abandoned the HEDT market as of now. Although the CPUs are technically still in production, distribution of these CPUs has been poor. Within the next couple of years, I would not be surprised if X299 and LGA 2066 are discontinued for enthusiast platforms with no successor whatsoever. That will force enthusiasts into a tough choice between the consumer LGA 1200 or successor platform and the ultra-expensive server platform with minimal (if any) overclock capability and relatively low clock speeds.

They havent abandoned anything. Its been known that Ice Lake-X will be the successor to Cascade Lake-X. Keep in mind HEDT is a descendant of the server platform. Current HEDT is Cascade Lake-X and current server was Cascade Lake-SP until June when they released Cooper Lake-SP. Ice Lake-SP is the successor to Cooper Lake-SP and that is the next step for HEDT. X299 and LGA2066 are already end of life. Ice Lake-X will bring in a new socket and a new chipset. X299 had a longer life then expected by having three series of chips on it rather then the expected two. As someone on the X299 platform i have no desire to downgrade to a mainstream platform."

			So I can buy a 9900 non K for 220 bucks. I actually would prefer AMD but I need strong single core performance for 3D vision games. What should I do
		
		Click to expand...
	
I mean, it's not hard to see why people think you want AMD as you literally said you would prefer AMD.



But back to your question:

The Intel discount skews the price/performance strongly to Intel.  I mean you're essentially getting a processor for ~60% of it's retail price.  The closest AMD comparison is probably the 3700x at ~$280.



However, the Intel 300 series boards are dead ends at this point while AMD will get one more product refresh in AM4 which very well could end up being a substantial improvement over the 9900.  Hard to say at this point as it hasn't been released.  As pointed out, you could get a 3600 now and then drop in a Zen3 product of your choosing later.  With Intel 300 boards, you don't have that option.



But the price/performance of the 9900 at $220 is too high.  There's no downside to buying it as you could probably make $80 selling it outright even if you went AMD.  Besides, it's not like the 10900k/10700k are anything different.  It's all the same core (starting at near double the price and up from there).  The closest new Intel comparison is the 10700 (non-k), and you're essentially getting one of those that's slightly faster with higher boosting for 2/3 of the price of that CPU."

I haven't built a computer in maybe 10-15 years... since core 2 duo's were a thing and the intel ""i"" series was in 1st/2nd gen. Things get busy and life takes priority. 

Anyways, thinking about building another pc. I'm a software dev and I do some gaming... so I'm wondering where the sweet spot is with cpu's these days. 



I would like for somebody to give me ""the skinny"" on the current cpu situation. 



Main questions:

1) Is it still worth it to always go intel? Is the cost of a mid-high end i-series worth it vs. a comparable performing amd ryzen?

2) Is now a good or bad time to buy/build? Anything new coming out soon that I should wait for?

3) which is the best bang for your buck, mid-high performance offering from both amd and Intel?

4) anything else you think i should take into consideration?



I was thinking of also building a basic server too- something that probably runs ubuntu server that funstions as a nas,  runs plex, maybe hosts some websites, maybe a LAMP testbed... but seeing as how they sell 8 year old dell power edge servers on amazon for 200$, I may just go that route, or just get a synology."

So why the 1680 v2 over the 2687W v2?

The 1680 is only 3.0GHz vs 3.4.  But the 1680 is 25MB cache vs 20MB.

I am guessing idea is to overclock the 1680 beyond the 2687 and it's only 130watts also, and lower cost?



Dumb question but if I OC my 3930K to say 3.5-4.0GHz will there still be significant difference between it and stock 2687w v2? 2 cores and 10MB cache more on the 2687



It's looking like changing processor will break some of my software licenses (mainly 3ds max) so it may be much less hassle to OC the 3930K unless that introduces instability.



regarding the GPU: Adobe CS6 (2012) supports ray tracing on old GPUs and not the newer ones which cause an error so I think the only supported GPUs I can get better than my GTX 780 are the first generation Titan (2013) or the GTX 780ti (2014?) and it's questionable as to the gain. Maybe the Titan is significant enough but again it may break my software licenses too"

			Honestly the CPUs were insanely more expensive when you built your PC. For the MSRP price of a 4960x (~$1000) or MSRP price of a E5-2687W v2 (~$2100) you still would have been better off with the 3930k then and spending that extra money now to build a new 3700 or 3900x based rig.



Do you have the actual model of your laptop's GPU and CPU? While it may have something to do with the NVME I suspect it also has a lot to do with a ~6 generation newer CPU and ~ 3 generation newer GPU. I'm sure it's more than enough to negate whatever clock speed advantage your desktop currently has.



Overclocking if done safely should net you decent gains without risking you cpu longevity. Just make sure you keep your voltages reasonable (under 1.5vcore iirc). 4-4.2ghz should be as simple as setting the multi to 40-42 and vcore to somewhere between 1.2 and 1.3. 4.5ghz+ should be obtainable if you really want to dive into it.

For gaming, the GPU is the difference. Wait for Ampere, not for new CPU."

			also note that Intel's TDP figures for non- T/S parts are generalized and tend to underrepresent power used by high-end parts and overrepresent power used by low-end parts. Example, the ""95W"" i5 in one of my systems actually sinks more like 60W under load.

			I checked it with Coretemp and it says I'm running at 3501MHz, and working with a 4K sequence in Premiere Pro the CPU core loads were around 70-100%, mostly between 80-100. The temps of the cores got into the 85-90 degrees C after only a few minutes.



Doing a v-ray render in 3ds Max all cores mostly stay at 100% and the temps climbed to upper 80 degrees and mostly stayed there, but even hit 90 and 91 C occassionally on all 6 cores, and they all changed orange and stayed orange(?)

It seems the temps change orange once they hit about 85 for a little while and change back to black once they drop into low 80s high 70s (or less).



I also noticed that the Frequency fluctuates between about 2900MHz to about 3500MHz during 100% render load.  But when the load is low the frequency stays consistant 3501.57MHz.  Is that normal?

Depends on your use case.  In a server, you'll rarely see a single core boost - it's all about the base speed - the V2 has a bit higher, but the W is generally a bit cheaper on the 2nd hand market (or was, haven't shopped that field in quite some time - I'm up to V4s in most of my boxes)."

			What tests are you failing exactly?  You have an awfully low Vcore in that screenshot @ 4.4Ghz..Don't be afraid to feed these chips voltage, anything up to 1.45V is fine, although I doubt you would need more then 1.4V to reach 4.5Ghz..Many people will feed them 1.5V+, although I wouldn't recommend that on air, as your one core is already pushing close to 80C..The ""Westmere"" cores in these CPU's are built on the same process as Sandy Bridge, and we all know how much SB loves Voltage..There are guys that have been running extreme 5Ghz+ O/C's on the 2500/2600K's since launch day, what 3~3.5 years ago?



Are you running 3 X4GB of ram? Or 6x2GB? If it is the latter, your IMC likely needs more voltage, even running the ram @ 1600Mhz.









What? IBT is fine, as long as you test it properly.  You need to run it on ""Xtreme Mode"" with all available ram.  The best way to test with it is to launch the program, and then open task manager and lock the core affinity to the physical cores, in the OP's case Cores 0,1,2,8,9, and 10. 



There is nothing wrong with using Prime95 either.  It uses all available threads and uses the maximum amount of power of all the stres tests, thus producing the most amount of heat which is key to determining if your O/C is stable.

			...just to revive this necrothread... (even if nobody cares any more about such legacy hardware).



But in these present times of sustainability I have tried the following:



Mainboard: ASUS P7P55D-E LX (LGA1156)

CPU: Core i7-860

New bought RAM at Amazon:

View attachment 212520

Corsair CMX32GX3M4A1600C11 XMS3 32GB (4x8GB) DDR3 1600 Mhz CL11 Performance Desktop Memory



According to TechSpecs, neither the CPU nor the motherboard supports 32 GB RAM. So the above config should not work in theory.



However. Here it's running now for three weeks (24/7) in my little homelab without any issues or problems  in my Windows 10 VMWare-Workstation-Host (VMWare Workstation 12.5) with eight VM-Guest. Also MEM-Test found no Problems.



I'm happy.

Hello rrx,



I have a core i7 860 too with ASUS P7H55-M  Motherboard : I would like to put 32 GB of RAM too.



Does Windows recognize all the 32GB of RAM, really ? May you share some screenshots with the app ""Speecy"" ?

Thanks

			I get it with SL.  They still have to run a business and warranty claims can be problematic, so they are probably conservative with their numbers.



So I set the PL1/PL2 to 225W.  Tau is set to 128 seconds, but I don't think it will make a difference since PL1/PL2 are the same.  I set the BCLK to 102 and my all core OC is ~4.7Ghz, single core ~4.9Ghz.  This is all running on air on my old OG Scythe Fuma.  IBT short run gets me around 75C and 160W power draw.  I might give 103 a go later, and that should net me another ~50Mhz on both single and all core.



Honestly, for $335, I can't complain.  I get 2C/4T more than the 10600k for slightly more money (much greater availability).  I bought a Z490 board anyway for the flexibility, but with manufacturers allowing power limit adjustments on the B460 boards, you can get a lot of bang for the (Intel) buck.

			I mean, it's not hard to see why people think you want AMD as you literally said you would prefer AMD.



But back to your question:

The Intel discount skews the price/performance strongly to Intel.  I mean you're essentially getting a processor for ~60% of it's retail price.  The closest AMD comparison is probably the 3700x at ~$280.



However, the Intel 300 series boards are dead ends at this point while AMD will get one more product refresh in AM4 which very well could end up being a substantial improvement over the 9900.  Hard to say at this point as it hasn't been released.  As pointed out, you could get a 3600 now and then drop in a Zen3 product of your choosing later.  With Intel 300 boards, you don't have that option.



But the price/performance of the 9900 at $220 is too high.  There's no downside to buying it as you could probably make $80 selling it outright even if you went AMD.  Besides, it's not like the 10900k/10700k are anything different.  It's all the same core (starting at near double the price and up from there).  The closest new Intel comparison is the 10700 (non-k), and you're essentially getting one of those that's slightly faster with higher boosting for 2/3 of the price of that CPU.

			When you're encoding, it should be pegging all cores at 100% at all times pretty much and never be thermally cycling.

Urm, no. No code is going to peg cores at 100% constantly, not even the best multithreaded code..



You would need a loop that fits in cache that just goes over and over stuff, generally that is not very useful



I propose a different test, we pit one 9900k against another, one with all this stuff enabled, vs another that doesn’t. I would bet money they are within a few percentage points of each other performance wise, but the one without pstates and cstates enabled will be hotter and use more power"

honestly unless you need the extra cores the 8700k is still a beast for pretty much everything besides multi-thread scaling applications. but either way i'd just wait and see what happens to 9900k prices, if they go down then you basically have yourself a 10700k without the expensive board."

			It depends.



If you can get a 9900k with a gigabyte z390 aorus (ideally Ultra, if not pro Wifi) for equal to or less than the price of the equivalent 10700 with motherboard, I'd get that, otherwise I would go 10700. I wouldn't worry about the 10900k for gaming, the difference will be marginal at best.



Note the 9900k is a vicious mistress that requires some special attention for cooling.



However, this all depends on the cooler. What cooler are you going to run on it?
		
		Click to expand...
	
either a top-end corsair AIO (lots of experience with them), Noctua NH-D15, or water if I feel like taking on a project.  Most likely the best AIO or the D15 - I tend to prefer the AIOs.  Going into a PC-O11, so plenty of room for the rad. 



9900K with the Ultra is cheaper than the 10700 plus a Z470 board. 



Thoughts on the cooling?  I always spend on the case and the cooling - the cooling is always worth it, and the case makes life fun building it."

			Only going to be gaming, so not too worried about all-core heat loads as much (I'm working on a final 3950 vs threadripper build for my workstation for that).  Thanks!



edit:  Damn, they're getting hot if stock puts you at 80c under load.

urm - no high 70s/80C under load is at 5ghz, all cores AVX, 1.272v.  I can probably get that voltage down a bit with a static voltage, but I prefer adaptive. Stock under load under the d15 is sort of low 60s with the fans not working hard..



If all it's doing is gaming, then a 280 (heck a 240mm) will be fine, depending on the overclock. For a benchmark, my processor at 5ghz puts out about 40-60W under 6 core load under assassin's creed odyessy, and about the same under doom eternal, these seem to be the most intensive games I have."

I'd love to help you and answer your question. However, I can't understand what you are saying. Or, anyone here who speaks Spanish or (whatever that is) please translate. Google translate was used here and I can't make sense of it.



EDIT: If I am understanding this correctly, the question here is whether or not the ASUS X299 WS Pro is as fast as the X299 Prime Deluxe II or the MSI X299 Creator. If that is the case, then the answer is yes. Motherboards do not really determine the speed of the system. They have very little to do with it. The CPU's all use the same base clocks and the same turbo boost features. Motherboards all have pretty much the same values for everything that impacts performance out of the box. 



Provided identical conditions these motherboards will all lead to the same level of performance. We've seen it countless times in the benchmarks results across motherboard reviews. The difference between motherboards comes down to a margin of error in the testing which is deemed acceptable. It's usually a 1-2% spread. The only area where one board may falter is if that board lacks certain specific features in the BIOS that could be used for performance tuning. Less expensive motherboards do not have all of the same features their more expensive counterparts do. However, this is something you won't even see when overclocking. The clock generators and VRM control of higher end boards usually amounts to more granular control over settings. Thus, you have more to work with when dialing in performance. 



That said, you really have to be pushing the limits of what a CPU can do in order to see these differences. Typically, you won't even see much of a difference while using custom water cooling. You have to step up to LN2 before you really see differences between most of these motherboards. I usually see the exact same results overclocking a given CPU on a variety of boards. The difference between a cheap motherboard and an expensive one is usually about 100MHz if that. 



However, memory tuning is another matter. Generally, the more expensive motherboards are far better at it. However, you need to buy RAM that's actually capable of achieving those speeds in the first place. That's the real issue as such memory is prohibitively expensive in most cases. Even then, it mostly comes down to what the more expensive motherboards can do in regard to tuning within the BIOS than it does the actual hardware. Hardware matters, and while price is something of an indicator as to what motherboard is better between the low and the high end, that's not always the case. 



Anyway, the short version is this: If you were to compare your CPU on all of the motherboards you mentioned, your performance would be identical across them provided they were configured the same way. Your system isn't going to be faster with a more expensive motherboard, or one of a different model. Unless your talking about overclocking, in which case there could be a difference, but it isn't likely to be huge without stepping up to more exotic cooling methods."

			I agreed I'm more interested in the low-mid range offerings, to many PCs to upgrade to sort about the fastest.  Also partially agree on the 14nm being to good, I think the biggest issue was they where able to pull so much frequency out of it, when they got 10nm going and couldn't get the speeds high enough it would have been impossible to sell.  If their 14nm called out at 4.5ghz it would have left a lot more room for 10nm, but they just refined it so much it took way longer to get 10nm up to speed.

Remember though, 10nm was supposed to be out before they got so high in the frequency, I think a combination of delays and subsequent refinement of 14nm together really made the issues worse.



Should see where things are soon, wating on benchmarks and real reviews, but normally rumors boost things up, but they haven't been to kind so far.  I feel it's going to be more cores, more heat, slight increase in some metrics, but nothing that's going to make anyone to excited to upgrade from a recent build. Maybe someone from an older build though.

The problem with the mid range offerings is the price.  You're still paying $260+ for an unlocked part which is $100 more than the 3600.  The plain old locked i5 is ~$190-200, but you're not going to get that 5Ghz boost speed.  You're only looking at 4.3 which is going to perform essentially the same as the 3600(x) for the same price.  It's not unreasonable for someone to put an extra $100 toward a video card instead of the unlocked CPU."

			Hi, I just build my system with Intel 10900k. Coupled with Asus STRIX Z490 E and Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB 3600. Cpu cooler is Corsair h150i 360 mm.

Ive installed everything, the system is working. I have a score of 6025 in Cinebench 20.

But I have a problem.

With Open Hardware Monitor and CPU-Z, I see the cpu goes up to 4900mhz in all cores, which is totally fine. I see some random cores go to up to 5.1, when my computer is started.

My temps are around 34C on idle and 72C in benchmarking.

I never see 5.3 as advised on Intel. No mater what option I change, I never reach 5.3. My temps are ok, so its not about that. I wonder if I'm missing some configuration on the BIOS. I have multi core enhancement to auto, pretty much everything in auto, like turbo boos, and avx.

I understand this feature should work by itself without messing around with bios settings.

Have anyone had the same problem?

Thanks

			Thanks for those links. I think AMD is doing 12nm so I mixed the two up. But even AMD does heterogeneous implementation as well. There is no need to use, in the example of your above screenshots, 10nm for the uncore portion of the die. There is just no need for it unless you want to run cooler but even then the uncore portion doesn't generate that much heat, not like the cores and cache and in the case of this chip the IGP when its being loaded down.



I am just really hoping to get an Ice lake or Cannon Lake X model for X299. Lets hope they follow suit like they did with X99 and have a couple generation that fit the board. I got an Asus Prime Delux for more than 50% off msrp. So that was an absolute legal steal and I don't want to relinquish the board so fast.

I seriously doubt anything 10nm will be working in your X299 board, highly unlikely to be compatible especially with Intel. You got a good current chip at least so you should be fine."

			No, no voltage/temp threshhold, it just cycled below because of lack of instantaneous load. Note peak temps were still below 80C, no way it was thermally/voltage throttling . I'll run Davinci for the entire encode if you prefer.



Thing is, you don’t need the processor to be running at 5ghz constantly, and it is not designed to do that.



It is one thing to say the 9900k is a hot processor, another to say “it’s a hot processor when you’re running it at maximum speed constantly”. You don’t redline an engine constantly when you’re driving at 10kph/mph, why should you do that when you’re running a chip? You also don’t need a fire breathing v8 to drive granny down to the shop (notice all those cores sleeping in the apex legends shot?)



It should be abundantly clear by now that my preference is not to do that. I don’t want my rig to burn power unnecessarily.

When you're encoding, it should be pegging all cores at 100% at all times pretty much and never be thermally cycling. You're going through p-states which is what speedshift does and it is never sustained. I could go turn on C-states and P-Shift and do the same thing but it would be disingenuous."

On a side note the main graphics card will give me a Windows Basic Display driver (gives me some sort of different hardware than posted error in device manager) unless I do a cold boot after changing any of my overclock settings.  Letting the system restart itself after saving the bios will give me this problem almost 90% of the time.  Is 4.4 just a bit too ambitious for a 3-way 980 GTX sli system on the X99-Deluxe?"

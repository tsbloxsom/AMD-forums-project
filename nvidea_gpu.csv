			The games visuals are being praised ,especially RTX but the real truth is ,the game is noisy and blurry and RTX is not all that great when you consider they Remedy or Nvidia removed cubemaps and stuff or just did not include them to make RTX look better.

I Played the game on RTX 2080 maxed out but put it aside until the visuals are fixed or there is a toggle to get rid of the noise in the game.

Saying that RTX is still the best to date and DLSS can double FPS when on because it cuts your resolution from native to 1/3 or 2/3 of native resolution.



I was shocked when I first played the Control game with how bad it looked to me on 4K screen.For some reason most people do not have a problem with it and that is fine.

Anyway during that time the prices were pretty much 450-500 for a 1080ti. This ranged from founders to aftermarket cards. I waited and found the holy grail 1080ti Kingpin and paid 575 for it in December. 



Being that the prices are still 450-500 pretty much i dont think you will see much difference until the ampere cards launch. Thats when you might see the market flood with 1080tis cause of people upgrading.

Without intimate knowledge of how the game works, none of us can tell you this.  It's possible that the system was doing something in the background that you're unaware of.  It's possible that, if this was the first time you ran this game, it had to compile shaders, and unlike other games, does this on the fly during the game, instead of up front.  It's possible that it  just didn't initialize properly for some reason, and was using a poorly optimized path through the game's code for each frame.



Again, if restarting the game fixed the problem, just play the game and don't worry about it."

			Me too, that's why I always turned it off



Thanks guys always thought I needed to turn off vsync, I'll try turning it back on to see if it helps. Does seem counterintuitive though but maybe I just don't understand the tech



What's the reasoning behind capping fps right below the refresh rate ? Any links to help me understand?



With my vega I used to turn on freesync and enhanced sync and left vsync off. However I read that some folks used vsync too with enhanced sync and freesync.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Because once your hit the max refresh rate of your display (or to be more precise, exceed it) you can't sync the display & GPU in any way other than v-sync (and all the variations on the tech like fast-sync etc.). So if you cap below that limit, you never find yourself playing with v-sync in the first place and instead remain in VRR territory. Why don't GPU drivers automatically cap your FPS to avoid that in the first place? I am not entirely sure, perhaps because the frame limiters built in the games tend to be a very little bit ""faster"" so they'd rather leave us the option of choosing how to cap our frames.



The narrow VRR range on yours means you are also always going to be close to the limits of your display, so the frametime compensation that the v-sync option adds to g-sync is probably even more critical for you than it is on other displays that can do 120hz and beyond. Explained here. Here, I don't factually know if AMD does the same thing with their v-sync setting. Haven't owned AMD hardware in a long time and never got the chance to test it.



VRR turns your screen into a slave of the GPU. But screens can't display an unlimited number of frames per second, so if the GPU is faster you either have no sync at all (lagless but you have tearing & stuttering) or you have v-sync and some amount of lag because of the buffering.



But if you cap your frames, you don't exceed the monitor's capabilities anymore. Bingo, you can have VRR - smooth, lagless*, tearing free.



*the only lag difference vs ""v-sync off"" is the lack of tearing: when you allow tearing, part(s) of the screen can show information a bit earlier than the rest - pretty logical when you think about it. But that's a really tiny number (a fraction of a frame!) no one should worry about. Again, explanations."

Says the man who forgot about Pascal.  It offered 80% performance over Maxwell.



Although 14nm to 7nm is not as big a leap as 28nm to 14nm was, it's still going to deliver 50-60% density increase and power reduction.  See here:



https://www.anandtech.com/show/1349...ction-of-chips-using-its-7nm-euv-process-tech



Nvidia was already able to to coax 20% efficiency increase with same die process  under Turning, so ""up to 70%"" is the range I would put things at (assuming die sizes are maintained.



I would expect somewhat smaller dies, so maybe 40-50%  better performance?  It would explain why they've waited almost two years to move on to a more advanced process node (harder to build large dies on a cutting-edge node)."

You only get input lag with V-Sync while using G-SYNC if your framerate is >= your refresh rate.  This is why it's still recommended to use an FPS cap to ensure that your framerate doesn't approach the maximum refresh rate.  It's all explained in the G-SYNC 101 article on Blur Busters.

			Looks like some games are worse at 1080p and some better at 1440p, which would leave me to believe at 4K, there may also be some benefit.  However; those results look to also be within the margin of error you could have simply be rebooting your PC.  Certainly curious on RT as it looks like on the one RT game (BFV) they had in that comparison, it was off.

I have a 120hz gsync screen and its hard keeping that high of a framerate as its pretty hard on the CPU. I personally find 85hz the sweetspot of visuals and system requirements. I can definitely see smoother motion at 85hz but beyond that I get the the feeling of the soap opera effect like everything is moving too fast and it doesn't look as cinematic. Also most cpus have no trouble feeding 85fps, whereas above that you can get some framerate volatility which causes its own series of visual glitches that I don't like."

Not sure about AMD/freesync.  But check out blurbusters for the explanation on gsync vs. vsync vs. no vsync.  If you're having problems with stuttering it is likely a driver or monitor problem.

This is a software issue.  The game is crashing due to bugs in the game.  You can likely avoid this by not leaving the game running for hours and hours unattended, but you keep insisting on doing that.  Stop leaving the game running for no reason, and you'l stop having these problems."

			For me, that is besides the point. When I spend $3500 on a new system, it serious pisses me off that I have to decide between Raid0 or 16x for my GPU. I understand your logic, that 16x on the GPU may be better than Raid0. Why am I being forced to choose between the the two? I would like both.



if I can get an AMD 4xxx this fall that does indeed beat Intel in gaming performance / single thread performance as I am a gamer first and not a kid that drops everything else for the sake of a few more cores, then I will finally make the move to AMD.



My 2 x WD Black 500gb NVMe's read and writes are in the 6,000MB/s range and yes, while there is a bit more latency with smaller files but Raid0 still has more benefits than not.



I was even lucky enough to have Kevin OBrien, the Lab Director for Storagereview.com respond back to me and tell me that the pro's of Raid0 NVMe still far outweigh the cons.



I reached out here to HardOCP forums about Raid0 and all I got back was rainy day responses. No one person was able to share any positives which told me I was asking the wrong people. Surely if anyone understood the pros and cons, you would have had at least a few people speak to both the pros and cons. So I had to look elsewhere.



Of course Storagereview.come people, especially the director is going to have the best knowledge in this area.

I think you're missing the point.  Regardless of what storagereview.com says, if you aren't actually using the increased speed of RAID 0 (or PCIe 4.0 in AMD systems) for anything other than e-peen benchmarks, it's no surprise that you're getting ""rainy day responses.""

That sounds exactly what I see with FreeSync with 60zh 3440x1440 secondary monitor to 144hz 2560x1440 FreeSyncII monitor. AMD Enhanced sync which syncs a frame to output of the monitor refresh rate when above Freesync range of monitor (not restricting FPS to the monitor refresh rate so as to to give less lag and less or no tearing) works great. I don't see any tearing even when above the FreeSync range. The rendering is tear free in and out of the FreeSync range or is totally transparent from my experience. There is no need to limit frame rate if reduce lag is wanted which works right along with Boost for very high frame rates for games supported. For high frame rate games it works extremely well."

I think Ray Dalio explains this best. The stock market doesn't go up or down in the short run because of the economy, it goes up and down based on availability of credit/money. Since the US money supply went up 30% after the crash, the stock market is up almost the exact same percentage (28-29%). The average increase of money supply over the last 10 years is about 12%, the stock market goes up about 11% a year. Over the long run (many decades) it follows the earnings of businesses and the asset inflation from liquidity injections eventually have to be sorted by corrections (i.e. 2000 and 2008). Buying the total market means you capture the entirety of money flows, i.e. it's a true inflation hedge, whereas stock picking is risky in that it's likely to miss out on the majority of the gains from money flows."

			Jolting sounds like to me is when framerates suddenly drop, say from 144 to 90, when it happens to me it looks like framerate suddenly went to zero for a split second. In my experience Gsync/Freesync doesn't really help with the visual affect of high frame-rate volatility. This just means your CPU isn't up to the task of maintaining the high framerate. Set your refresh rate to 85hz or something lower so there's less demand for CPU resources and it should be silky smooth.

			oops,  I misread that the 12pin was still 4amps. 



All of the +12v pins are tied together so that each wire (ideally) will have the same load pulled through it as the others.  So it would be impossible to tell if a 6-pin or 8-pin connector is plugged in by adding another power handling line.  So you still have an isolated line there, but now you have to add complexity to ensure that voltages are stable and correct before reading that active high signal (and depending on the logic used to do that you may need to convert it to safe levels).
		
		Click to expand...
	
Yes, they are tied together, but you can still put a sense on a single leg of that line if you so want (current sense would be my guess?).  Changing the plug slightly so a 6-pin wouldn't fit would have of course been annoying because PSU's would have had to include both connections instead of just a single one that can be split to support both, but would have made the transition easier without even needing to sense anything.

			converting 48v to 1.xV  requires much faster switching VR circuits (i.e. more expensive) or double conversion (i.e. inefficient on a small scale).  It's good for datacenters since the reduction in ongoing costs quickly outweighs the higher initial cost,  but consumer devices would never see the payback.
		
		Click to expand...
	
It does require faster switching, but at this point it's not to big of an issue like it used to be.  I mean, right now we are already doing multiple conversions anyways, your PSU does 120vac -> DC, then regulates it at 12VDC which is then regulated to 5v and 3.3v.  Also, the 12v that's sent to your GPU and CPU is also regulated down to the 1.xx V that is required by the CPU, 1.35V (give or take) for your ram, and a slew of other voltage levels (GPU core, GPU memory, misc signals for DVI/hdmi/displayport, timers, control voltages, etc).  If the power supply only had to generate a single 48v rail, they would be almost negligible.  Of course your MB/GPU would have to convert 48v into it's required voltages (gpu, ram, etc) but it's already gotta do that anyways from the 12v.  This would have a bigger impact on ssd's and HDD's, but we see intel is already trying to get the MB to supply those voltages with their 12v only PSU.  It would allow the power traces to be much smaller going to the VRM's, but after that it'd be pretty much the same.  I could understand PSU manufacturers not wanting to do this as it would mean you don't need as good of regulation and much less components in the PSU which would cut into their sales tremendously.  It would also take an awful large paradigm shift, so the chances of it happening anytime soon are slim to none, but hey .  I could see this happening in the server space eventually though and then shifting down into consumer level."

Then upgraded to 2x GTX680 in SLI.  When I upgraded to my i7-5820K, that was during the height of the cryptocurrency boom that inflated GPU prices, so instead of getting a new card, I took advantage of the large number of PCIe lanes on the X99 chipset and got a 3rd GTX680.  I used the 3x GTX680 cards up until last year when I upgraded to a 2080 RTX, and then when I upgraded to an AMD 3900X setup 6 months later, I put the 3x GTX680 cards back into my i7-5820k setup to use as my backup system.



For me, I can say that my experiences with 4-way Crossfire and 3-way SLI over the years have been largely positive.  Part of that is because I've never been one to play dozens of games at the same time.  I usually dedicate most of my time to a small handful of games, and thankfully over the years they have all had good SLI/Crossfire support.



When things changed for me was with DirectX 12, which pretty much killed SLI and Crossfire because of this fantasy idea that each game developer could write multi-GPU code directly into the game instead, and get better utilization than traditional SLI/Crossfire.  In the real-world, pretty much no game developer actually bothers with this.  SLI/Crossfire still works in many cases, but you have to run the game using DirectX 11, not 12.  This is what I do when I run my backup 5820k system that still uses the 3x GTX680 cards.  Those cards don't support DirectX12 in most games anyway, so it's not really much of a concession.  I wouldn't want to be stuck having to use DirectX 11 with a new GPU though."

			The games visuals are being praised ,especially RTX but the real truth is ,the game is noisy and blurry and RTX is not all that great when you consider they Remedy or Nvidia removed cubemaps and stuff or just did not include them to make RTX look better.

I Played the game on RTX 2080 maxed out but put it aside until the visuals are fixed or there is a toggle to get rid of the noise in the game.

Saying that RTX is still the best to date and DLSS can double FPS when on because it cuts your resolution from native to 1/3 or 2/3 of native resolution.

These are actually the programs from your list that has little to no impact.  Magician literally does nothing while it is running on Windows 10.  You should only use it if you need to check drive health, run a benchmark, or update firmware.  The three that I would expect having an impact are GeForce Experience, iCUE and EVGA X1.



I've had issues with iCUE eating up CPU cycles while running in the background.  It's an issue that rears its head every other update.  The version I'm currently on doesn't have a performance impact.  I noticed that there is a new version out this week, so maybe they broke it again.



If you have the OSD enabled in either iCUE or EVGA X1 then I would disable them.  Also make sure the FPS limiter in X1 is disabled.  If you need an FPS limiter use the one in the NVIDIA control panel.



In GeForce Experience I would disable streaming, if you haven't.  Also make sure you're not inadvertently recording something with ShadowPlay.  Also, disable Freestyle."

The renders crashing has actually been an issue for months, but I've mostly been able to work around it until recently. GPU 3 going on strike is brand new though.

I just don't see any kind of advantage. If you use an adapter you're still going to need to have at minimum two six-pin connectors available from your PSU."

But Gaming has much lower margins than Datacenter.  This profitability is NOT covered by NVIDIA's revenue reports.



Most estimate I've read put datacenter profit margins at at least 2x that of consumer cards.  That means you would have to make TWICE AS MUCH YEARLY REVENUE to turn a larger profit from gaming.

It used to be really the only way to get decent frames at 1440p and above.

You need a Beast of a GPU for this, not just for the RT cores to do the intersection testing, but shader cores for shading, and then the denoising component.  Nearly every effect needs those three steps, and here repeating those steps multiple times over in a single frame.



Shading + Denoising each RT effect is often taking more frame time than Intersection RT core work!



Look at the frame breakdown. Reflections - Bunch of Green on graph for RT cores testing the rays.  But then there you have to shade those Rays of the Reflection on the surface, then finally you need to denoise.



There isn't going to be a big jump in RT HW soon because you need more of everything. More RT Ray testing, more Shading performance, and more Denoise performance.



Doesn't hurt that reviews are also making this out to be a pretty great game as well.

They supported their 3D Vision way after it was released actively, not everyone was happy but I think Nvidia was pretty committed. PhysX also comes to mind being supported while maybe not really advanced lately because CPU's have greatly improved with more cores. I expect RTX to be around for a very long time. Gsync is another. While some, including myself at times complain it is being proprietary, fragmenting the PC etc. At least money is being spent to improve it without having to go through endless committees for approval. Customers can also just say no if the price is not worth the value given. So Nvidia GSync pushed AMD to get an open standard, AMD DX Mantle pushed Microsoft/Nvidia on software and hardware. Competition actually is the best thing for consumers in the end so I do hope AMD has better RT methods and results over Nvidia and that Nvidia also improves dramatically with Ampere -> win win for us."

			Yes, they are tied together, but you can still put a sense on a single leg of that line if you so want (current sense would be my guess?).  Changing the plug slightly so a 6-pin wouldn't fit would have of course been annoying because PSU's would have had to include both connections instead of just a single one that can be split to support both, but would have made the transition easier without even needing to sense anything.
		
		Click to expand...
	
You have to know that there's something plugged in before you can enable power so that you know how much power you're allowed to draw.  Current sense isn't going to work so well if there's negligible current flowing.  Also,  it's still more complexity than just popping a ground onto an open collector and reading what's there.










	
	
		
		
			It does require faster switching, but at this point it's not to big of an issue like it used to be.  I mean, right now we are already doing multiple conversions anyways, your PSU does 120vac -> DC, then regulates it at 12VDC which is then regulated to 5v and 3.3v.  Also, the 12v that's sent to your GPU and CPU is also regulated down to the 1.xx V that is required by the CPU, 1.35V (give or take) for your ram, and a slew of other voltage levels (GPU core, GPU memory, misc signals for DVI/hdmi/displayport, timers, control voltages, etc).  If the power supply only had to generate a single 48v rail, they would be almost negligible.  Of course your MB/GPU would have to convert 48v into it's required voltages (gpu, ram, etc) but it's already gotta do that anyways from the 12v.  This would have a bigger impact on ssd's and HDD's, but we see intel is already trying to get the MB to supply those voltages with their 12v only PSU.  It would allow the power traces to be much smaller going to the VRM's, but after that it'd be pretty much the same.  I could understand PSU manufacturers not wanting to do this as it would mean you don't need as good of regulation and much less components in the PSU which would cut into their sales tremendously.  It would also take an awful large paradigm shift, so the chances of it happening anytime soon are slim to none, but hey .  I could see this happening in the server space eventually though and then shifting down into consumer level.

I have run SLI in games several times with different cards for 10+ years.  Even with games that do not support SLI, Nvidia has a “force SLI” option in their control panel which has never let me down.  I have never been dissatisfied with SLI, but I have never mismatched cards before.  I always got the exact same model number as mine.  But this time I ended up getting a Kingpin addition 980 Ti a while back, and their model numbers are somewhat rare.  So I figured well would a 2nd 980 Ti of any variant work.  I gave up after about 30 minutes of googling and not finding an answer of if different sub variants of a card would work with each other.  My greatest apologies for aggravating your special specialness.



Problem is I need an analog output which new cards do not have.  My cheapest and fastest option at the moment is another card of mine (980 Ti). I only originally mentioned a 2080 for an example.  Anything under the Nvidia 2000 series is not worth the bump in performance from 1 980 Ti - based on different benchmarks I have seen.  So replacing the 980 ti with a 1080 ti may not be worth it.  Or a 1670.  Only path that may be worth it is either SLI 980 Ti or a 2070/80series.  But the 2000 series + the digital to analog adapter I need puts me in a price range I didn't want to spend on right now.  A 2nd 980 ti should bump me up a decent amount for only a few hundred bucks which is a LOT cheaper than a 2070 or 2080 + cost of digital to analog adapter."

People are assuming COVID is delaying GPU's because it sort of makes sense. Nvidia already didn't have much reason to launch a new product without competition from AMD, but add in a global pandemic and economic recession, and that's a bad time to launch a new, expensive product of any sort.

i usually ran my founders card at 35%-40% fixed fan speed 24/7 and it was fine. no over heating, and no issues at all.



in that photo it looks like you already have them set manually to 45% fan speed. so does the 45% fan speed work of not? 

to me it sounds like your saying the problem is the card wont work properly with its stock fan curve profile. if it will accept manual changes like you setting it to 45% like you did in the photo, set it to a fan speed were the noise doesnt bother you and be done with it. thats what i was suggesting earlier. 

if you cant set manual fanspeed (or percentages) it has a problem that simply changing a fan or the entire cooler wont fix. its either firmware level or PCB level."

Nvidia Ampere gaming products? Competition will be AMD? As for Intel I see nothing on the horizon or anything that would threaten either one. With AMD future commitments, focus and great success recently, indicating very good management, AMD is likely to affect Nvidia Gaming brand of sells more so then in the past. Any Nvidia unique innovations for the upcoming gaming cards as well as AMD's will have to be seen and then the market to respond.



With the downturn in the World economy I would expect OEM, Other and Auto to decline (Other most likely Nintendo Switch could increase, especially if a newer more robust version comes to market).



The gaming market drives innovation, gives solid base or clout for large volume purchases which will influence foundry support, control and long term standings with a number of manufacturers for best prices and support, gives large presence overall in mindshare and control of resources mostly from developers, OEMs, retailers etc. that will also promote your products, name independently with no additional cost to Nvidia.

Stocks are up from the depths they sunk to back in March. A couple months ago, The Rona was not as well understood and there was much more uncertainty about how bad it was going to get.  The situation seems to have stabilized but there are still thousands of Americans dying daily due to this awful virus. News you see of people partying at Lake of the Ozarks on Memorial Day Weekend is not an accurate reflection of most Americans' sentiments.  Folks still are not eating out, they still are not traveling, they're still not buying cars and making other big purchases.



I think the current highs are temporary and when the Q2 earnings are reported in early/mid July, stocks will mostly tank again.  Q2 is going to be BAD.  Unemployment will recover to an extent but it will still be BAD.  I know 'everyone knows that so it's already accounted for in current valuations,' - except I don't think folks know how bad Q2 really is, and the market likes to react strongly to strongly negative data.  There will be many bargains to buy up in early/mid July.  I bought into a lot of travel stocks back in March and plan to buy more (from different companies) if I turn out to be correct and the market dives again in July.  Those to me are going to be medium-term investments - I'll want a new car in about three years.

Agreed on the Q2 results, most people I know are just buying stocks right now like nothing happened.

			I have run SLI in games several times with different cards for 10+ years.  Even with games that do not support SLI, Nvidia has a “force SLI” option in their control panel which has never let me down.  I have never been dissatisfied with SLI, but I have never mismatched cards before.  I always got the exact same model number as mine.  But this time I ended up getting a Kingpin addition 980 Ti a while back, and their model numbers are somewhat rare.  So I figured well would a 2nd 980 Ti of any variant work.  I gave up after about 30 minutes of googling and not finding an answer of if different sub variants of a card would work with each other.  My greatest apologies for aggravating your special specialness.



Problem is I need an analog output which new cards do not have.  My cheapest and fastest option at the moment is another card of mine (980 Ti). I only originally mentioned a 2080 for an example.  Anything under the Nvidia 2000 series is not worth the bump in performance from 1 980 Ti - based on different benchmarks I have seen.  So replacing the 980 ti with a 1080 ti may not be worth it.  Or a 1670.  Only path that may be worth it is either SLI 980 Ti or a 2070/80series.  But the 2000 series + the digital to analog adapter I need puts me in a price range I didn't want to spend on right now.  A 2nd 980 ti should bump me up a decent amount for only a few hundred bucks which is a LOT cheaper than a 2070 or 2080 + cost of digital to analog adapter.

It does look uninspired but the setting is a basic office building after all. Sometimes it's hard to separate technical improvements from art style and texture quality.



Based on the info posted so far Control uses pretty advanced rendering techniques for volumetric lighting, screen space reflections and ambient occlusion. Turning down a few settings from high to medium seems to help a lot.

With the Turing architecture, we set out to change gaming with two big leaps in graphics: real-time ray tracing, and AI accelerated graphics. Ray tracing provides the next generation of visual fidelity, and our first use of real-time AI, DLSS, boosts performance so you can enjoy that fidelity at higher frame rates.



As an AI algorithm, DLSS is constantly learning and improving. Deliver Us The Moon demonstrates this continuous improvement, with DLSS delivering a 1.6x+ boost in frame rate while providing comparable image quality to native resolution with Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA).



This means that gamers can play at higher output resolutions and frame rates with ray tracing enabled - the GeForce RTX 2060 delivers 80 FPS at 1080p with RT and DLSS, and GeForce RTX 2080 Ti owners can enjoy the definitive 4K 60 FPS ray-traced experience."

You're all correct though - for a person who isn't looking to upgrade PSUs anyway, this is a pretty minor thing. An adapter will easily convert two 6-pins into this new form factor. I am one of those ""purists"" though, who would prefer my PSU to support the form factor natively, or at least can be upgraded with modular cables to seem as such.

You still had to have separate 4MBx4MBx4MB 192-bit memory spaces reserved for each card: so it ended-up being VASTLY more expensive than the 16MB 128-bit Voodoo 3 2000 (same performance as 24MB Voodoo 2 SLI).



The OP asked about why we don't have multiple dies on the same video card, and the response is: you're still going to have to provide dedicated memory for each die.  Given the small market for such EXTREME performance/pains getting it to scale in modern games, most people are just going to wait around until the next generation single-die cards release, so there's no inherent demand.



People were a lot more willing to experiment in the the 1990s, but now, they know a bad value when they see it (you buy SLI now, you wait twice as long to get new features.  And in the meantime, you have to keep buying an SLI-capable system every tme you upgrade.)  SLI on a single card didn't improve performance, nor did it lower the costs of the rest of your system."

Perhaps a good long term thing to think about now that we see where power is really going in most systems - the GPU.

Also, easily adapted into older systems.



Sure, it does imply at least one company wanting to increase headroom on a halo product. I think that's fine. Push the highest-end up further - there's a market for that.

Although for most, it may just be that you get one nice connector instead of running two for even mid-range cards. Also good."

			As an owner of 2080 Ti SLI, I'd say avoid it like the plague (well, if you follow the modern day trend, you'll just end up getting it haha). But seriously, I have two cards, and the games that you don't need SLI you can run perfectly fine with one card, and the games that SLI would help hit that sweet 120FPS 4K spot don't support it. Just get one faster card (I plan on doing that for the 3080 Ti+).

I have had a 4870x2 (2 cores in 1 card for you youngins), 2 x 7970s in Crossfire, and 2 x 780s in SLI. Support in games was always shit, even AAA titles. I believe AMD and Nvidia have both said on record that they aren't really doing any development on them anymore. Just put your money together and get the best card you can buy, or just 1 2080ti, and send the other $1300 to JMCB and me to split for saving you a headache."

			Thanks man,



I set Max Frame Rate to 58, turned on Fast (it's under the Vertical Sync drop-down right?). It's like a stutter almost, not really tearing as I said before. It doesn't come through when screen recording but I took a video with my mobile and the effect kind of comes through at the beginning and especially around the 1st turn. With Vsync its similar I think. I don't even know what to call this effect.. hitching?







I actually left it set in game. I'm gonna set it in the control panel like you suggested and turn it off in game. See if it helps
		
		Click to expand...
	
If you use Fast Sync when your FPS is below the refresh rate then you are essentially using unbuffered V-Sync as the GPU will hold a frame until the monitor is ready to refresh.  It is generally a bad idea to use Fast Sync with G-SYNC as the two conflict with each other.  This is what causes the hitching.  It could also be caused with you setting the minimum Freesync range below what the monitor was made for.



V-Sync + G-SYNC is not V-Sync in the normal sense.  Using V-Sync with G-SYNC ensures that the VRR output is synced to the scanout of the monitor to prevent any judder, otherwise the GPU will push a new frame before or after the front buffer has completely cleared."

The one thing that concerns me after getting to the end of that video is that a 2080 Ti can't maintain 60 fps at 1080p with everything on high.

HBM has already solved the ""how do we feed this thing, in incredibly tiny form-factor"" problem for the last five years.



We still have yet to find a mainstream  consumer-oriented l use-case that will give those multiple GPU cores on the same package a reason for their existence.  That is the reason why nobody is paying the premium fon consumer-level HBM cards anymore



Even Intel had to dream-up a use-case nobody cares about like Lakefield to justify all their FOVEROS work.



Even Ice Lake doesn't make use of the external eDRAM anymore. Their stack engineers were bored and looing for something to do.. why not create pointless competitions for ARM mixed-core chips?



Until you have a plan, you're just shooting the breeze.  That is what Intel has been doing, as there is no mass-market use case for CPU die stacking, much like there is no easy use case for stacking multiple GPUs on the same package. The only viable die stacking has been the traditional horizontal CPU placement used by Zen 2/Pentium  4/Core 2 Duo.



Leave package stacking for complex circuits that actually benefit from it, not for inventing some new DOA mobile x86 device product category like MIDs was?

Yeah the breakdowns are really interesting. Goes to show that there’s a lot happening each frame and performance is bound by different things depending on what type of work is being done.



I don’t know how accurate that visualization is but I was surprised to see such low memory bandwidth usage during the RT steps. Maybe the entire BVH structure fits in L2.



It’s probably just how the graph was drawn and the green RT section is blocking the memory graph."

My main complaint is that it keeps getting installed. Then Windows decides that it needs to be the new audio output, because it's new, and because the speakers are disabled on my monitor, I have to take a moment to remember to switch back to one of my sound devices and then go in and disable the monitor's audio again.

			I was in a similar boat.  I just bought it for the 4k performance.  When I tried the extremely limited ray tracing applications in the games that supported it I could see why so many people were frothing at the mouth about it.  Minecraft looks promising, but again it's minecraft, a game that runs on (old) cellphones, so to see this level of rat tracing applied to a game like cyberpunk may be a bit far off from where we realistically are. 



However, when games are built from the ground up with ray tracing hardware in mind, they may be able to do things we haven't yet seen, so for that I am tentatively holding out hope for.  It may be 2 or 3 years till we see the next gen consoles get that type of a game to market, but these technologies always take time for adoption, just look at multi core cpu games.  We're just now starting to get more games scaling with higher core counts.

Also can take time for the hardware to be less shit. I mean it seems like the RTX series don't have a lot of ray tracing power. No surprise, they need to be good at rasterization as that is how games do things, even ones that have some RT bolted on. So the first gen stuff is pretty weak. However they may be able to scale it up as time goes on. A good example from the past is pixel (and vertex) shaders. When programmable shaders first happened, they were a bit shit. GeForce 3 cards had them, but games couldn't do a lot with them because they were pretty weak. So they'd get used to do a little simple bump mapping or making water shiny, but that's it. However now it is how everything is done, every pixel is handled through a shader program, often complex ones with many layers (texture, light, displacement, specular, occlusion, etc). The power of the shaders has grown to the point that now most of the silicon on a card is the shaders, the ROPs, TMUs, all that jazz are just a tiny part.



So we could see future generations of cards have much more raytracing muscle and thus be able to do more than just some kinda ""meh"" shadow effects or ray trace extremely old/simple games slowly. Now we'll just have to see. It also may be the case that RT takes up too much silicon to really do right, and we are getting to the point where node shrinks are not what they used to be, so maybe in the long run it'll be too costly to add enough logic to really do it, and it'll forever be a gimmick kind of addon, or even something that fades away. Really nobody knows, including the GPU makers, at this point. We'll just have to see. They certainly think it is wroth pursuing though."

			8-pin only has 3 power wires and 5 ground wires.... The 12 pin has 6 & 6, so it's twice the power lines which leads to twice the power (about 4amps per).  This 12v connector can (in theory) carry up to 600 watts.  The spec on a 6 pin is only 75w (although most any recent implementation can carry 150w just like 8-pin since they both have the same # of +12v lines) with 8 pin being 150w.  So in theory dual 8 pins can carry 300w while a single 12 pin can carry double that.  This makes some sense as dual 6 pins won't be enough to feed a 350w GPU (if used within specs), but dual 8-pins + 75w pcie power will just be enough (150+150+75 = 375w).  If they are indeed making a 600w GPU this would be much better than 4x 8-pin connectors.  The broke compatibility due to the fact that 8-pin has only 3 +12 and 5 gnd pins... Meaning one ground pin is on the same side as power.  This connector keeps +12v on one row and the on the other.  Not sure WTF they were thinking with 8 pin connectors honestly.



Ps just wanted to make sure I answer your questions:

OG 6-pin spec is only ~2amps per pin, they increased it to 4amps per pin for 8-pin, but didn't increase the # of 12v lines, and since most connectors are the same for 6/8 pin, they can both actually handle 4-amps and 150watts, but that's not ""spec"" even if true.
		
		Click to expand...
	
12pin can only have up to 6 +12v since it must have at least one ground pin for each one.  That's only 300w, not 600.



As for the 8-pin having a ground on the same side as the power,  it's not actually not a ground.  It's one of the two sense wires the card uses to detect whether an 8-pin, 6-pin, or no connector is plugged in so it can set the correct power limits to operate at.

To be fair, it barely gets 60FPS at 1440p with RTX off.



I just got this game, did settings and that was it.  Basically going to try maxed with DLSS and you can choose to upscale from 1080p or 1440p to 4k.  These might be two seperate options...  “render” and “dlss”.



From a different review DLSS gave almost a double FPS improvement. Just gotta see the IQ impact.



You can also pick and choose RT settings for types of RT.

Compatibility with 99% games, no game profiles, near ~100% scaling in all games and most importantly it is only SFR so no input lag increase, no frame pacing issues and no micro stuttering bullshit.

If Nvidia SLI also just worked then I bet we would see quite a lot of cards using more than one chip and a lot more people would use multiple cards.

Each chip still had to have its own memory and keep copy of all textures and own framebuffers, albeit smaller because each card rendered at half (or quarter in case of Voodoo 6 6000) resolution.



GeForce 256, the card that Voodoo 5 5500 competed with had four pixel pipelines so in fact it was already a ""quad core"" chip.

It quite exactly opposite to what OP was claiming and GPU did it first.

With CPU's it was always an option also. Nothing technically stopped eg. Intel from making dual Pentium Pro/II/III if they really wanted. They did not want it because at this time processor clocks were rising in such fast pace it would not make economical sense to double/quadrupple transistor budget and run in to TDP issus (which would be silly compared to today...) on something most software/markets could not utilize, especially when they already had the easier means to increase performance with clocks. Also most software people used could not utilize it at OS or any level and for server and workstation markets you could always put more processors.



With GPU's because driver could easily split workload between cores and which was transparent from software point of view and clock scaling was much harder it made more sense to go with multiple cores/pipelines."

it is possible that you're running your NVME drive in SATA mode? Which would free up the PCIE lanes."

That being said, looks like one of the better attempts and lots of settings to turn on/off things you like or don't like or make to much of a bit.

How many here cracking their jaws actually have and curently using a SLI rig? Anyways above is a good list which if one was going to want to play several of those will be very much pleasantly surprised. Shadow Of The Tomb Raider using SLI was out of this world. FarCry5 as well. If you 4K game and the right games as in the ones you really want to play and would appreciate them, SLI is still an option.



What gets me are the whiners that want every game to run flawless with SLI, that has never occurred, even in the so called delusional hey days of SLI and CFX. Just can't sit still when one of the cards is not being used or having to turn off SLI to run a new game that, well already plays great with one card. Do I recommend SLI, yes, only to those who know what they are doing and understand the limitations of the technology. It was always a super enthusiast option, always had issues, always had many games that did not play well with it, will always have issues with when there are frame dependencies like in TAA, was always very costly which at times did not provide any benefit when used or even degraded the experience. Yet at times it would give you an experience you would have never had if you did not have it."

I've often forgotten to cap my frames at 141fps on my 144hz monitors and truth be told never noticed - the transition between g-sync and v-sync is totally smooth and transparent and at such high refresh rates the lag is too small to matter for the majority of users.



What is mandatory (if you never want to see tearing) is having v-sync enabled in the control panel's global profile, it should override whatever the games try to do, with rare exceptions, so it's not critical to turn v-sync off in the games themselves but still recommended.



As long as v-sync is off, g-sync can still tear at times, even within its range, because of occasional frametime variances."

When if it pulls back, I don’t think tech stocks are immune.  I’d rather have index or mutual funds in general as well — but thats only because I’ve been burnt hard on individual stocks too many times.  I’d prefer picking up health sector right now, or long term picks to feel comfortable weathering the next correction and its difficult to have much confidence in an individial tech company more than a couple product generations out.  In an uncertain market nvidia just seems riskier to me.  I’m no longer expert investor however.

Diversity is key, and mutual funds or ETFs are a good way to do that.  Much like you, I had been burned before, but that's also how you learn.  I do a lot of research now and retain about 40% of my picks as individual stocks, typically dividend payers as to always generate reinvestment cash.



However, if you snagged nvidia in the dip, 100% worth it.  Nvidia is not just gaming anymore and I see their AI business expanding, and that's not me, that's the research I have done.  It's probably a bit high, but so was amazon at $300+ once.  It's always a gamble, but if your looking for a quick profit, your doing it wrong.  I'm buying shares in a company for 15 years down the road, not right now or even this year.  In 15 years, even at it's high price now, you will still make some damn good money I am willing to bet."

			Agreed - I also see the card coming with the needed adapter if they do come out with this new 12pin connector on the high end Nvidia GPUs, so I also really don't see why all the fuss is being made.  Some purists might want a PSU that has this new cable/plug natively provided...  If so, they can decide to go with a new PSU.  Most folks building a brand new rig would probably be buying a new PSU anyway.   PSU companies just lap this stuff up when they have something new/different/novel to market and drive sales.  Life goes on.

Those same purists most likely have a modular PSU which can easily accept a new plug if they aren't to old of a PSU and the MFG feels like making one or 3rd party could make one, or worst case build their own connector like they do now when they sleeve their wires.  Since it's similar enough connector it'd probably be enough to just unpin 2 6 pin connectors and push them into the 12 pin in the right order.  People are making it out to be like everyone will have to buy a new PSU but in reality, very few will have to unless their PSU is to weak to begin with."

			I have to say, I've not been really impressed with the 'reflections'; perhaps that's largely because they're not that hard to fake with careful set design.



But the shadow and color gradients from surrounding light sources really cannot be easily faked, and to me, that's what's most convincing about ray tracing. Developers almost never get that stuff right everywhere, and with ray tracing, it's 'correct' by default.

The thing with fund of funds is the expense ratio is a bit higher just to avoid personally rebalancing. You could own the total stock market and total bond market funds and just pay a 0.035 avg expense ratio and balance the fund ratios yourself.

			That alone almost completely wipes out your entire list of laptop buying options, as every single big-name PC brand is also forcing this heavy-handed update-reverting process. Your only choices now outside of MSFT are a Chromebook or a MacBook.



And all this is because MSFT is now pushing the DCH graphics driver model, but big-name OEMs for the most part refuse to support it when it comes to Intel GPU drivers.



That is why my next laptop purchase at any time within the foreseeable future will be a MacBook. I will, however, continue to use MSFT on my desktop as I do not currently have an Intel CPU with an IGP whose drivers MSFT could potentially screw around with.

I have not had this problem with Lenovo, so far. On my XPS 15, the biggest annoyance was still seeing Killer Networking (service from Rivet) being forced through Windows Update when I was on my ~6th or so clean install of Win10, and the laptop had not had the Killer Networking card installed since install #2.



At that point, I gave up on Dell entirely. They may have nice looking specs, especially with the new XPS lineup, but they aren't getting my money again."

			Sorry, I should have been more clear.  The 12 pin doubles the amperage of the 8-pin to a bit over 8amps (~8.5) from 4 AND doubles the pin count hence you can get 4 times the watts (150 -> 600).

Yes, I understand they have a sense pin, but that makes no sense, why not just supply 1 more +12v and one gnd to supply more power?  What good does the sense pin do besides let the GPU know it's got an 8-pin plugged in?  They could have easily done the same thing by checking if that pin had 12v on it... or have a slightly different connector so someone couldn't plug a 6-pin connector where an 8-pin is required?  I wonder how many GPU's actually use the sense pin or just ignore it and assume.  Just seems a wasted opportunity where it could have had 200watts per 8-pin instead of 150watts (they can supply 50 watts per pin @ 12v).



I'm more curious if we'll start seeing higher voltages passed around to keep the amps down.  Now that would require a new PSU but efficiencies would go up (and wire sizes could go down and/or less pins on connectors and voltage losses on cables won't be as critical).

12v @ 4 amps = 48 watts

24v @ 2 amps = 48 watts

48v @ 1 amp = 48 watts
		
		Click to expand...
	
oops,  I misread that the 12pin was still 4amps.   



All of the +12v pins are tied together so that each wire (ideally) will have the same load pulled through it as the others.  So it would be impossible to tell if a 6-pin or 8-pin connector is plugged in by adding another power handling line.  So you still have an isolated line there, but now you have to add complexity to ensure that voltages are stable and correct before reading that active high signal (and depending on the logic used to do that you may need to convert it to safe levels).










	
	
		
		
			So with 48v you could reduce wire sizes AND reduce pin counts on connectors.  A single 18 gauge wire can carry ~10amps at the short runs in a case.  So a SINGLE 48v line could carry 480 watts.  Make a 4 pin connector like we have for MB's that can carry 10amops and you would have close to 1000watts available for any device with just 4 pins (of course they'd want a safety margin, so say 750watts).  This would be something I would be interested in, much more than just making bigger connectors.  You can get a lot more power through the same size wire/connector with higher voltages.  This is why electric vehicles run such high voltages, the wires would be as heavy as the car (and impossible to run/land) if they didn't.  OSHA considers anything under 50volts safe to work on live (meaning it's voltage is low enough not to harm people if touched directly while running).  This is why I don't think it should/will go any higher than that.
		
		Click to expand...
	


converting 48v to 1.xV  requires much faster switching VR circuits (i.e. more expensive) or double conversion (i.e. inefficient on a small scale).  It's good for datacenters since the reduction in ongoing costs quickly outweighs the higher initial cost,  but consumer devices would never see the payback."

I use both Nvidia and AMD GPU's (at times many of them). If a driver problem hits what you want to do, some may think the world and the company is falling apart while most don't notice a thing. Yes if you have a serious issue then it becomes a problem for you. I've had issues on both Nvidia and AMD drivers, that is why they get updated to support new programs and to fix bugs which many actually can be the program viced the driver, that has to be worked around, maybe even a compiler bug yet to be fixed by Microsoft. I like that AMD and Nvidia post the known bugs, except I really think the list is too short, so these are probably the top 10 or so being reported.



The new drivers give initial support for the new games listed, which if you are playing you now have something that will work. Now if you are playing also games that are broke -> . Some options are having multiple computers and GPU's etc. Console or just be smart how you prioritize your game play."

			The OP asked about why we don't have multiple dies on the same video card, and the response is: you're still going to have to provide dedicated memory for each die.  Given the small market for such EXTREME performance/pains getting it to scale in modern games, most people are just going to wait around until the next generation single-die cards release, so there's no inherent demand.

With AMD approach (and Nvidia in high end) of integrated memory and GPU interposers, it is now becoming less of a barrier to entry. Intel is already banking on this approach and it's only a matter of time. I hope it works, would be good to see some reasonable pricing for Nvidia again.

Benchmarks?  Yeah, didn't think so.  If Fixall is only getting ~100fps @ 1440p with an overclocked 2080ti, how can you be so sure next gen will be 180% faster than an overclocked 2080ti to make this happen?  (160% more pixel + 20% more fps needed).  Judging by the leaks, we're looking at maybe 30% increases, that's enough to maybe run 2k @ 120hz with high settings.  Nowhere near 4k 120hz unless you turn settings down.  Since the OP said MAXED I assume he did't mean with settings turned down, so he's probably going to be waiting at least for the 5090ti before that's a reality, maybe 6090 or rdna 3+."

G-sync plus enabling Vsync in NVCP fixed the tear and made the game smoother. I never felt any additional input lag. I already figured this out on my own even before the Blurbusters G-Sync 101 article was published but what I did learn from Blurbusters is about frame capping about 3 frames below max refresh to avoid V-Sync induced input lag. That said, I only framecap 2 frames below with RTSS on MP games that consistently exceed the max refresh rate of the monitor which works well for me. For SP games or graphically demanding games where the FPS is always below max refresh, I don't bother with frame-capping anymore.

We are still mostly TDP and memory (bandwidth and cost) limited. You cannot increase TDP indefinitely because sooner than later you run in to much higher card manufacturing cost and higher failure rates which are not good for business.



Also keep in mind that most revenue for eg. Nvidia is from HPC markets where margins are much higher than for consumer products and that there is limited manufacturing capability in manufacturing fabs to produce physical dies. It would make absolutely zero sense for them to lower prices for consumer products and risk having issues with chip shortages. If Nvidia had unlimited production capabilities it might make some sense to be more aggressive with pricing to get most out of consumer GPU market. Because of all that I would not expect RDNA2 to be cheaper either. Maybe AMD will have more incentive to be cheaper to regain some market share but it won't be by much."

With G-SYNC you enable it in the NVIDIA Control Panel, not in games.  You should get no additional input lag when V-Sync is enabled in the control panel with G-SYNC unless your framerate is constantly hitting the refresh rate.  You should turn up game quality settings until you're within about 70% of the max refresh rate, or otherwise use an FPS limiter."

			To be fair, it barely gets 60FPS at 1440p with RTX off.



I just got this game, did settings and that was it.  Basically going to try maxed with DLSS and you can choose to upscale from 1080p or 1440p to 4k.  These might be two seperate options...  “render” and “dlss”.



From a different review DLSS gave almost a double FPS improvement. Just gotta see the IQ impact.



You can also pick and choose RT settings for types of RT.

Overall this game is a perfect example of increasing game demands fighting off gpu performance improvements with diminishing returns in IQ.  



The fact that a 1080ti barely gets 60 fps at 1080p is pathetic considering the visuals.  It's all an excuse to get people to buy $700+ GPU's every 2 years.



I am guessing this is an Nvidia sponsored title, though I guess that is a given with RTX."

Maybe, just maybe, you should save and quit this game when you're going to leave it for 12 hours, versus just leaving it running.



I don't think this is a hardware issue - it sounds like the game just doesn't handle idling for hours very well.  All of the signs you mention point to a situation where the system says to the game ""My friend, you know all those resources we lent you, control of mouse, GPU, monitor, and so forth?  I am afraid we will need those back, my friend.  Today."" And then the game says ""Oh, shit, uhhh, hang on a second, I didn't think you'd need those back so soon, man.  I'm gonna need a few days to get them all together.""  and then the system says ""My friend, I would hate for my associate in Garbage Collection to feel the need to pay you a visit.

Nothing right now. 



Stocks are up from the depths they sunk to back in March. A couple months ago, The Rona was not as well understood and there was much more uncertainty about how bad it was going to get.  The situation seems to have stabilized but there are still thousands of Americans dying daily due to this awful virus. News you see of people partying at Lake of the Ozarks on Memorial Day Weekend is not an accurate reflection of most Americans' sentiments.  Folks still are not eating out, they still are not traveling, they're still not buying cars and making other big purchases.



I think the current highs are temporary and when the Q2 earnings are reported in early/mid July, stocks will mostly tank again.  Q2 is going to be BAD.  Unemployment will recover to an extent but it will still be BAD.  I know 'everyone knows that so it's already accounted for in current valuations,' - except I don't think folks know how bad Q2 really is, and the market likes to react strongly to strongly negative data.  There will be many bargains to buy up in early/mid July.  I bought into a lot of travel stocks back in March and plan to buy more (from different companies) if I turn out to be correct and the market dives again in July.  Those to me are going to be medium-term investments - I'll want a new car in about three years."

I was in a similar boat.  I just bought it for the 4k performance.  When I tried the extremely limited ray tracing applications in the games that supported it I could see why so many people were frothing at the mouth about it.  Minecraft looks promising, but again it's minecraft, a game that runs on (old) cellphones, so to see this level of rat tracing applied to a game like cyberpunk may be a bit far off from where we realistically are.  



However, when games are built from the ground up with ray tracing hardware in mind, they may be able to do things we haven't yet seen, so for that I am tentatively holding out hope for.  It may be 2 or 3 years till we see the next gen consoles get that type of a game to market, but these technologies always take time for adoption, just look at multi core cpu games.  We're just now starting to get more games scaling with higher core counts."

Ive only bought/sold used hardware locally. I've just heard too many stories that'd give me headaches.



Maybe I'm thinking that the 3000 series is going to be such a leap foward that it'll drop the older gen hardware's prices drop like a rock. My fear is that it'll only be worth $250-300 after the 3000 release.



The only game I really have my eye on in Cyberpunk in the near future (D4 as well, but who knows when that's coming out). If I can still sell it for around $400 at that time (CP2077 release) and put towards a 3000 series I think I'll be happy.

For me, that is besides the point. When I spend $3500 on a new system, it serious pisses me off that I have to decide between Raid0 or 16x for my GPU. I understand your logic, that 16x on the GPU may be better than Raid0. Why am I being forced to choose between the the two? I would like both.



if I can get an AMD 4xxx this fall that does indeed beat Intel in gaming performance / single thread performance as I am a gamer first and not a kid that drops everything else for the sake of a few more cores, then I will finally make the move to AMD.



My 2 x WD Black 500gb NVMe's read and writes are in the 6,000MB/s range and yes, while there is a bit more latency with smaller files but Raid0 still has more benefits than not.



I was even lucky enough to have Kevin OBrien, the Lab Director for Storagereview.com respond back to me and tell me that the pro's of Raid0 NVMe still far outweigh the cons.



I reached out here to HardOCP forums about Raid0 and all I got back was rainy day responses. No one person was able to share any positives which told me I was asking the wrong people. Surely if anyone understood the pros and cons, you would have had at least a few people speak to both the pros and cons. So I had to look elsewhere.



Of course Storagereview.come people, especially the director is going to have the best knowledge in this area."

it’s completely right, my overwhelming focus has always been on a set of ETF’s that I rebalance if it gets overweight. >14% of our gross household income does that. Even aside from anything else, our retirement is almost certainly golden.



It’s still good fun to have the discretionary fund though. I have a rule after losing $16k on telcos in early 2000s and just buy things I like. Or it is clear to me from work that it will do well. I’ve just been lucky that thanks to the likes of the [H] and working in the mobile space for 7 years that has worked out.



Amazon (2001), ARM (2006), Google (2007), VMWare (launch), Apple (2007), Nvidia (2014 originally), Facebook (launch + 2 weeks), AMD (2017). Think that’s pretty much it. Actually Some Chinese car company. I went to China before the 08 olympics and saw a lot of cars *shrug*, don’t even know when I sold it.



ARM has gone (10 bagger, woo), VMWare I sold as I think / thought they’re screwed, Nvidia I sold out recently  but think they’re fine. (And actually have been a problem in my portfolio periodically for growing too much). 



AMD I’m gonna hold just because I’ve got a feeling and I want to play it out. If they get IPC on the next Epyc with newly price sensitive companies and lot of cloud sales being made, Big Navi is in the ball park and the new consoles do well, I think it’s still got some legs; but it’s emotional, by rule that’s the one I should also sell. Everything else I’m stuck with because of tax.



As someone mentioned earlier, AMD was fucking obvious for the [H]ard, I’ve never advised people ever, except in March and April 2017 when I told everyone to take a look."

I'm still waiting to update to 20H1 until a couple bugs are fixed, but there is plenty out there since it has been in insider builds for a few months now.  In CPU bound situations it's supposed to spread the load out more evenly among your CPU cores.  It is also supposed to make your framerate more consistent in V-Sync or FPS-limited scenarios.  You may see a slight bump in average FPS (5%) overall.  I have not read about any kind of detrimental effects or issues when using this feature.  This feature is part of DX12 Ultimate, so you also need a driver that supports the updated API in addition to W10 20H1."

			""CUDA core"" is a misnomer. Those ""cores"" inside SM block are just execution units that execute the same instructions on multiple data kinda like SIMD units on CPU. This is what you typically want in graphics oriented workloads, just process bunch of pixels in exactly the same way. Of course these ""cores"" are a little bit more advanced with various degree of freedom but the general idea is the same and such core does not contain everything that is needed to execute code.



If we are talking about multiple GPU cores that are equivalent to CPU cores then the term is SM blocks for Nvidia and Compute Units for AMD.

In theory you could have whole Nvidia GPU with just one SM block and it should work just fine.



Besides, in modern processor you also have multiple execution units per core but we do not call those as ""cores"". In CPU's what we usually want is higher IPC so those execution units are trying to help to get as high IPS as possible but we can also utilize those execution units using SIMD extensions in a way very similar to how CUDA ""cores"" are used withing SM block. It is not exactly the same thing and capabilities are somewhat different but general idea is the same.

			They already do if the game supports DX12. I had a pair of 2080's in NVLink/SLI and Rise of Tomb Raider showed the pooled memory using DX12, SLI, DXR and DLSS before I sold them and went to a single 2080ti. DX11 has to be specially coded for pooled memory for example: Grand Theft Auto V. Otherwise, the second card's memory is not utilized, just the second GPU.



Also, NVLink (while basically SLI) is way more advanced and is really utilized in professional settings 3D rendering, Some Adobe products, Maya, et cetera...it offers massive amounts of bandwidth where AMD Crossfire uses the PCIe Bus and can constrain the bus.



NVLink/SLI/Crossfire while cool (and a feature I would use if more games supported it) just is not being coded for by the developers even though the support is already baked into the major game engines and DX12 Ultimate that most of the games use on their backend.

For the stinking price of $1,200 flagship video card, s__t! I'd be better if it had more than ONE core, DIE or whatever it'd be called. Nevertheless.......

			12pin can only have up to 6 +12v since it must have at least one ground pin for each one.  That's only 300w, not 600.



As for the 8-pin having a ground on the same side as the power,  it's not actually not a ground.  It's one of the two sense wires the card uses to detect whether an 8-pin, 6-pin, or no connector is plugged in so it can set the correct power limits to operate at.







Just like they didn't when 6pin PCIe connectors replaced 4pin Molex connectors..  or when PCIe 8pin replaced the 6pin?  No. Just like before they'll throw an adapter in the box for the first couple generation of cards.

They already do if the game supports DX12. I had a pair of 2080's in NVLink/SLI and Rise of Tomb Raider showed the pooled memory using DX12, SLI, DXR and DLSS before I sold them and went to a single 2080ti. DX11 has to be specially coded for pooled memory for example: Grand Theft Auto V. Otherwise, the second card's memory is not utilized, just the second GPU.



Also, NVLink (while basically SLI) is way more advanced and is really utilized in professional settings 3D rendering, Some Adobe products, Maya, et cetera...it offers massive amounts of bandwidth where AMD Crossfire uses the PCIe Bus and can constrain the bus.



NVLink/SLI/Crossfire while cool (and a feature I would use if more games supported it) just is not being coded for by the developers even though the support is already baked into the major game engines and DX12 Ultimate that most of the games use on their backend."

I wanted to know a few details, from anyone that has recently been Streaming on Mixer or Twitch.  I've been out of the game and am looking to start streaming again, and surprisingly in the little while I was away, many things have changed.  Apparently Nvenc is king and H264 cpu encoding is no longer the king of providing the best quality stream.  In the past, I had a 2nd Rig to encode my stream and upload to Mixer (where I was streaming last).  So I had a 2 pc Setup, 1 Gaming and 1 Streaming.



Most recently I understand that Streaming with RTX cards using Nvenc there is a huge quality and efficiency upgrade and this is the way to go, especially if you have the hardware already. 



I'm looking to buy new hardware and will probably hold out for the RTX 3000 series hoping to take advantage of any improvements with the GPU encode efficiency they may bring. But if I'll need to buy 1 or 2 Cards, or 2 rigs, in yet to be determined.  That's what I'm hoping your feedback may help me with.



Currently, is anyone in this community streaming using RTX Nvenc?  If so with Which cards, and what kind of performance impact is it having if you're doing it all on the same Rig?



Anyone using a 2 pc setup to stream or Multicard?  If so, has that benefited your stream quality, what are the specs and what made you decide to do it this way?  Does the Nvidia driver let you set anything up if you install more than one card on the same rig e.g. Card A runs game, Card B for Nvenc?



I'm excited that the Nvidia Encoder has grown to be such a powerful tool in terms of streaming and Game Capture, I'd imagine that the 3000 series will usher in a much better streaming/gaming experience (fingers crossed). 



Feel free to post specs and pics of your setups, but the most important things I'm looking for is the performance impact, if you're seen benefits from the recent drivers and updates in terms of stream quality and performance, and also if you use a 2 pc setup. 



One last question... If you stream to Mixer, is there any problem streaming with the 0 delay FTL setup and Nvenc on a RTX card?  Would hate to invest only to find out that they don't play nice together.



Mods, feel free to move this to another section of the forum if you feel it fits better elsewhere.



Thanks in advance L.E."

V-sync is NOT actually v-sync if you are within the g-sync range - it simply activates a function to compensate for occasional and sudden frametime spikes. Originally nvidia did not even allow us to mess around with the v-sync setting for that reason. Your issue is elsewhere. Or maybe you were just hitting your refresh rate limit (or maybe your games were not running at your maximum refresh rate, it can sadly still happen even with the ""prefer highest refresh rate"" option).



From what I recall they gave us the option to force v-sync off around when AMD released Freesync, because AMD's default setup let your framerate go out of the VRR range, which lets you tout slightly lower latency numbers (if you go higher than your refresh rate) with very high framerates, but nothing else. For some reason nvidia never bothered to explain or clarify the settings and people like those on blurbusters had to do the digging and write down the explanations. And the default g-sync setup nowadays (with a clean install) doesn't even have v-sync on anymore, so I can understand the confusion and why so many seem to get it wrong and complain about tearing with g-sync on. It kinda baffles me to be honest, nvidia could easily make a g-sync default setup that's good enough for 99.9% of users, if not more, especially with their new built-in frame limiter."

I have a GTX 690 that had had some corrosion occur to the back of it, such that a tiny 0402 size SMD resistor had a flaky connection.  This resistor happened to be part of the enable line on one of the VRMs, and it would cause the card to intermittently just not turn on, because the solder joint at one end was flaky.



I mention this because the PWM control for the fans on most graphics cards works in such a way that, if the PWM signal goes away, the fans go full blast, and the way that the PWM signal works likely has a couple of tiny resistors pull up or pull down resistors.

			Select features in OpenCL 2.0 are available in the driver for evaluation purposes only. The following are the features as well as a description of known issues with these features in the driver:  Device side enqueue •The current implementation is limited to 64-bit platforms only. •OpenCL 2.0 allows kernels to be enqueued with global_work_size larger than the compute capability of the NVIDIA GPU. The current implementation supports only combinations of global_work_size and local_work_size that are within the compute capability of the NVIDIA GPU. The maximum supported CUDA grid and block size of NVIDIA GPUs is available at http:// docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compute-capabilities. For a given grid dimension, the global_work_size can be determined by CUDA grid size x CUDA block size. •For executing kernels (whether from the host or the device), OpenCL 2.0 supports nonuniform ND-ranges where global_work_size does not need to be divisible by the local_work_size. This capability is not yet supported in the NVIDIA driver, and therefore not supported for device side kernel enqueues.  Shared virtual memory •The current implementation of shared virtual memory is limited to 64-bit platforms only.

			Depending on the value proposition and production situation, it could be really hard to get the card you want at a decent price within the first few weeks, if the past is anything to go by.

Other than blind luck, if it's a situation where there isn't enough stock for for day 1 demand at retail price (which is very likely and to some extent encouraged,) most day 1 purchasers will be paying a premium (again, other than a small number  with that crazy f5 place an order fast luck) .

It won't help that some ebay sellers will look to buy up anything at a decent price.

Then there's the wait for 3rd party coolers and prices period which makes you question whether you should buy a launch card even if you could get one at a good price - all in all, I find the current setup with GPUs (on both sides) to be a total fluster cluck. While consoles also can have some launch shortages, the situation quickly resolves, but the 2080 ti remained hard to get the right card at the right price since day 1. You had to make it a hobby to hunt one down at a good price until a year+ after release, which is really crappy. This is why some competition from AMD would be great, I really hope all this Navi 31 stuff turns out to be true and incoming, and that they are able to dampen the sense that there's no other game in town but the Ampere A102 for high end performance (or whatever the 3080ti / 3090 is).



Apple solved this problem with the iPhone launches by letting you order even with quite a backlog through their website and you would typically get your phone in 2 weeks at MSRP (for the last 2-3 years at least). In fact, in the last few years you could typically get easily a 20%+ discount by black friday which is not too far from the sept. launch window.



I hope there's enough stock and that Nvidia has some plan to deal with demand and avoid price gouging, but I doubt it.

I used to be able to force SLI on almost any game, but now it is a complete disaster.  I spent more hours than I will admit tweaking Nvidia profile inspector. At times I would actually see a gain of 50-60% fps increase, but what good did it do with so many artifacts.  At least old games that were programmed to use SLI still took advantage of it.  TAA has to be disabled since it also breaks with SLI.  Even if it did work with TAA who knows what else would have to be disabled in the future to force it to work. Nvidia broke SLI so bad that even if I disabled SLI, I was still getting odd DX and driver crashing errors I didn't get before.  Oh I so tried clean installing so many old drivers and even tried Nvidia's latest driver.  The more I kept reading at how SLI has been thrown aside the more disgusted I got.

Guess I'll start reading up on NVLink, and I shouldn't be surprised there is a hopeful SLI successor.



Anyways, it looks like the 2070S will give me that bump in performance I think will be acceptable, so I will probably be going with that.  I should be able to hold out for the 3000s to be released to hope the 2070 prices will go down.  I already ordered the adapter I needed."

			12pin can only have up to 6 +12v since it must have at least one ground pin for each one.  That's only 300w, not 600.



As for the 8-pin having a ground on the same side as the power,  it's not actually not a ground.  It's one of the two sense wires the card uses to detect whether an 8-pin, 6-pin, or no connector is plugged in so it can set the correct power limits to operate at.
		
		Click to expand...
	
Sorry, I should have been more clear.  The 12 pin doubles the amperage of the 8-pin to a bit over 8amps (~8.5) from 4 AND doubles the pin count hence you can get 4 times the watts (150 -> 600).

Yes, I understand they have a sense pin, but that makes no sense, why not just supply 1 more +12v and one gnd to supply more power?  What good does the sense pin do besides let the GPU know it's got an 8-pin plugged in?  They could have easily done the same thing by checking if that pin had 12v on it... or have a slightly different connector so someone couldn't plug a 6-pin connector where an 8-pin is required?  I wonder how many GPU's actually use the sense pin or just ignore it and assume.  Just seems a wasted opportunity where it could have had 200watts per 8-pin instead of 150watts (they can supply 50 watts per pin @ 12v).



I'm more curious if we'll start seeing higher voltages passed around to keep the amps down.  Now that would require a new PSU but efficiencies would go up (and wire sizes could go down and/or less pins on connectors and voltage losses on cables won't be as critical).

12v @ 4 amps = 48 watts

24v @ 2 amps = 48 watts

48v @ 1 amp = 48 watts



So with 48v you could reduce wire sizes AND reduce pin counts on connectors.  A single 18 gauge wire can carry ~10amps at the short runs in a case.  So a SINGLE 48v line could carry 480 watts.  Make a 4 pin connector like we have for MB's that can carry 10amops and you would have close to 1000watts available for any device with just 4 pins (of course they'd want a safety margin, so say 750watts).  This would be something I would be interested in, much more than just making bigger connectors.  You can get a lot more power through the same size wire/connector with higher voltages.  This is why electric vehicles run such high voltages, the wires would be as heavy as the car (and impossible to run/land) if they didn't.  OSHA considers anything under 50volts safe to work on live (meaning it's voltage is low enough not to harm people if touched directly while running).  This is why I don't think it should/will go any higher than that."

No, never has, never will. As has been explained before already on sites like blurbusters. On nvidia, the v-sync setting is literally a part of g-sync that can be optionally turned off for very limited benefits (the benefit is that your framerate CAN go beyond your refresh rate which will turn off g-sync so you get unlimited frames and slightly less lag, ie. you just play as if you didn't have any form of ""sync"" enabled - so tearing and stuttering are back). In the early days you couldn't even touch it for that matter. Having v-sync disabled also means you can get a bit of tearing (usually one single line near the bottom) even when fully in the g-sync range because of frametime spikes that cannot be compensated for.



They only added the option to turn off v-sync with VRR when AMD did and pretended it was an ""advantage"" of Freesync as far as I can remember."

Sorta,



Gaming is not a side business for NVIDIA.  The total revenue over the course of the year is probably 50% higher than datacenter.



But Gaming has much lower margins than Datacenter.  This profitability is NOT covered by NVIDIA's revenue reports.



Most estimate I've read put datacenter profit margins at at least 2x that of consumer cards.  That means you would have to make TWICE AS MUCH YEARLY REVENUE to turn a larger profit from gaming."

			I thought your explanation was good, but why can't you simply cap your FPS at your monitor's refresh rate? Like cap it at 144fps for a 144hz monitor.  Why does it have to be a few below?  What is the purpose of that buffer?
		
		Click to expand...
	
There are two issues here, one that is easy to understand is that your refresh rate is never exactly 144, its something like 143.9xx or 144.011 or something, so you'd have to measure it very precisely and then use a very very accurate frame limiter (which means only Rivatuner could be even remotely usable - and that would still require a loooot of tinkering to get it right), most frame limiters will try to stick to a target but the framerate might go a bit higher or a bit lower anyway, in game limiters can have a delta as high as 10+ frames which is obviously terrible for this use case so better give yourself some headroom when using one of those.



The second issue is less clear to me, but has to do with how g-sync works - apparently g-sync disengages a bit before the refresh rate limit is reached (so if you have v-sync off, you get tearing, if you have v-sync on, you get v-sync). Even on blurbusters they do not seem 100% sure why it works that way though."

That DF video was really excellent. It mentions that in Control they're using one ray per pixel which is much higher than what BFV uses and performance is better. That's a massive improvement. 



They seem to be applying Rt effects to even the most mundane objects in the scene (coffee makers, phones, extinguishers). With that level of detail the performance they've achieved on first gen hardware is impressive.



The side by side comparisons really help to highlight the limits of what we can do with rasterization alone. This gives me hope that the consoles will actually be powerful enough to make RT a standard feature in a few years."

According to everything it will be a standard feature on the HW next year when new consoles release, but it will still be early generation HW and it might be the console generation after that, that really exploits it in most games.

It was actually AMD who forced Nvidia to release a Studio Driver and support gaming cards for cuda loads in the first place since AMD pushes OpenCL. AMD released their professional driver for a lot of their gaming cards and flip between drivers for different things: Gaming vs Pro stuff with crossfire for both enabled if I wanted. I ran a pair of Vega Frontier Edition cards with the gaming drivers most of the time. They were a lot of fun but that is when I first started to see the performance losses in crossfire and overall multi-gpu glitchyness.  That also shifted the market a bit and Nvidia was forced to respond in kind with the Studio driver."

			I am still waiting for a logical reason why a 'new' 12 pin power connector will deliver more power versus the 'old' 6+6, 6+8 or 8+8 adapters if the gauge of the wire stays the same.
		
		Click to expand...
	
8-pin only has 3 power wires and 5 ground wires.... The 12 pin has 6 & 6, so it's twice the power lines which leads to twice the power (about 4amps per).  This 12v connector can (in theory) carry up to 600 watts.  The spec on a 6 pin is only 75w (although most any recent implementation can carry 150w just like 8-pin since they both have the same # of +12v lines) with 8 pin being 150w.  So in theory dual 8 pins can carry 300w while a single 12 pin can carry double that.  This makes some sense as dual 6 pins won't be enough to feed a 350w GPU (if used within specs), but dual 8-pins + 75w pcie power will just be enough (150+150+75 = 375w).  If they are indeed making a 600w GPU this would be much better than 4x 8-pin connectors.  The broke compatibility due to the fact that 8-pin has only 3 +12 and 5 gnd pins... Meaning one ground pin is on the same side as power.  This connector keeps +12v on one row and the on the other.  Not sure WTF they were thinking with 8 pin connectors honestly.



Ps just wanted to make sure I answer your questions:

OG 6-pin spec is only ~2amps per pin, they increased it to 4amps per pin for 8-pin, but didn't increase the # of 12v lines, and since most connectors are the same for 6/8 pin, they can both actually handle 4-amps and 150watts, but that's not ""spec"" even if true."

			No, never has, never will. As has been explained before already on sites like blurbusters. On nvidia, the v-sync setting is literally a part of g-sync that can be optionally turned off for very limited benefits (the benefit is that your framerate CAN go beyond your refresh rate which will turn off g-sync so you get unlimited frames and slightly less lag, ie. you just play as if you didn't have any form of ""sync"" enabled - so tearing and stuttering are back). In the early days you couldn't even touch it for that matter. Having v-sync disabled also means you can get a bit of tearing (usually one single line near the bottom) even when fully in the g-sync range because of frametime spikes that cannot be compensated for.



They only added the option to turn off v-sync with VRR when AMD did and pretended it was an ""advantage"" of Freesync as far as I can remember.

I have no faith in this actually working. I'd guess vendors will still be allowed to force updates.



Why do I have no faith in MSFT?

I had to deal with MSFT and Dell forcing outdated Intel GPU, ""Waves Audio"" junk, and ""Killer Network"" trash drivers onto my laptop (XPS 15 7590).

Force install new drivers --> WU overwrites it a few days later.

Force install new drivers with Safe mode, Drive Store Explorer, Device Manager, and DDU --> WU overwrites it a few days later.

All of the above, plus registry fix to prevent WU from updating any driver whatsoever --> WU overwrites it a few days later.

All of the above, plus group policy preventing WU from updating specific drivers (Audio, Network, GPU) --> WU overwrites it a few days later.

All of the above, while restoring to Dell OEM recovery image --> WU overwrites it a few days later.

All of the above, minus OEM image, and using clean Win10 install --> WU overwrites it a few days later.



Repeat the last two 4-8x, each. You are not misreading that.



I see Intel has now released universal drivers, but I have since sold off that garbage laptop from a vendor that will never get my money again. Rivet (Killer) ""uninstaller/blocker"" still allowed a service to slip through and Windows Update still forced a service and driver through. The audio was most infuriating. Old GPU drivers, I could almost live with. Killer's malware, I could almost tolerate. Waves Audio completely butchering audio output, inducing stutters (DPC improved greatly without it) and not being removable really pushed me over the edge. Some combination of the GPU drivers and Waves Audio also lead into the Nvidia GPU drivers (which were updated) BSODing the laptop (very reliably). Dell support correctly diagnosed it as a software problem, and just said: ""pay up more for Software support"" after hours on the phone.



An 8 month struggle to deal with this eventually pushed me away from:

""CUDA core"" is a misnomer. Those ""cores"" inside SM block are just execution units that execute the same instructions on multiple data kinda like SIMD units on CPU. This is what you typically want in graphics oriented workloads, just process bunch of pixels in exactly the same way. Of course these ""cores"" are a little bit more advanced with various degree of freedom but the general idea is the same and such core does not contain everything that is needed to execute code.



If we are talking about multiple GPU cores that are equivalent to CPU cores then the term is SM blocks for Nvidia and Compute Units for AMD.

In theory you could have whole Nvidia GPU with just one SM block and it should work just fine.



Besides, in modern processor you also have multiple execution units per core but we do not call those as ""cores"". In CPU's what we usually want is higher IPC so those execution units are trying to help to get as high IPS as possible but we can also utilize those execution units using SIMD extensions in a way very similar to how CUDA ""cores"" are used withing SM block. It is not exactly the same thing and capabilities are somewhat different but general idea is the same."

I set Max Frame Rate to 58, turned on Fast (it's under the Vertical Sync drop-down right?). It's like a stutter almost, not really tearing as I said before.

That is a fallacy based on your own wants. If the economy is badly damaged by all of this then most likely most will just be built for the professional market to recoup costs. They may eventually release a consumer one if the market recovers quickly and they feel they can sell a high enough quantity to justify the investment. Quantity is the deal breaker as the more you make the cheaper it gets to build, you just have to have enough demand at the price you need to sell at. If everything smoothes out quickly and the world goes back to normal then you might only see a small delay. But right now that is looking unlikely. Go to Detroit and go to a car plant and go look at the droves of cars and you will know that they indeed will sit on inventory and they cost a whole lot more to make then a video card."

			I have no faith in this actually working. I'd guess vendors will still be allowed to force updates.



Why do I have no faith in MSFT?

I had to deal with MSFT and Dell forcing outdated Intel GPU, ""Waves Audio"" junk, and ""Killer Network"" trash drivers onto my laptop (XPS 15 7590).

Force install new drivers --> WU overwrites it a few days later.

Force install new drivers with Safe mode, Drive Store Explorer, Device Manager, and DDU --> WU overwrites it a few days later.

All of the above, plus registry fix to prevent WU from updating any driver whatsoever --> WU overwrites it a few days later.

All of the above, plus group policy preventing WU from updating specific drivers (Audio, Network, GPU) --> WU overwrites it a few days later.

All of the above, while restoring to Dell OEM recovery image --> WU overwrites it a few days later.

All of the above, minus OEM image, and using clean Win10 install --> WU overwrites it a few days later.



Repeat the last two 4-8x, each. You are not misreading that.



I see Intel has now released universal drivers, but I have since sold off that garbage laptop from a vendor that will never get my money again. Rivet (Killer) ""uninstaller/blocker"" still allowed a service to slip through and Windows Update still forced a service and driver through. The audio was most infuriating. Old GPU drivers, I could almost live with. Killer's malware, I could almost tolerate. Waves Audio completely butchering audio output, inducing stutters (DPC improved greatly without it) and not being removable really pushed me over the edge. Some combination of the GPU drivers and Waves Audio also lead into the Nvidia GPU drivers (which were updated) BSODing the laptop (very reliably). Dell support correctly diagnosed it as a software problem, and just said: ""pay up more for Software support"" after hours on the phone.



An 8 month struggle to deal with this eventually pushed me away from:



Dell, Intel, & MSFT, in order of distaste (and willingness to ever purchase something from them in the future).
		
		Click to expand...
	
That alone almost completely wipes out your entire list of laptop buying options, as every single big-name PC brand is also forcing this heavy-handed update-reverting process. Your only choices now outside of MSFT are a Chromebook or a MacBook.



And all this is because MSFT is now pushing the DCH graphics driver model, but big-name OEMs for the most part refuse to support it when it comes to Intel GPU drivers.



That is why my next laptop purchase at any time within the foreseeable future will be a MacBook. I will, however, continue to use MSFT on my desktop as I do not currently have an Intel CPU with an IGP whose drivers MSFT could potentially screw around with."

			90% of games could be RTX enabled, and you could still complain it isn't in the games you want to play.

I own two RT-enabled games that I know of -- BF:V, for which the implementation is awful (though pretty) and further requires the use of DICEs awful implementation of DX12, and the other is 3DMark, which isn't even really a game. And I play far more BF4.



Reality is, while RT 'just works' in the sense that relatively little work needs to be done to get it running on Nvidia hardware (and likely AMD hardware when that arrives), the gaming industry is very slow to take up new rendering paradigms.



With DX12 / Vulcan, that's doubly so because the benefit is only really there for complex, graphically intense games over their predecessor APIs, and low-level graphics APIs are a pain to work with. DX11 works and works well.



And then they have to not only implement RT, but also tune the hell out of it to make sure that it's only being used where it will actually make an improvement to the game content in question.





I get why this process is slow. AMD being as slow as usual to market isn't helping market adoption of the hardware, and Nvidia running on an old node meant that their initial chicken-and-egg RTX gambit wasn't going to be as effective as it could have been.



But we'll get there. AMD has RT hardware coming to the desktop and to consoles, and Nvidia has new hardware on the way too. Right now it's hard to recommend purchasing a GPU without hardware RT, in the near future, you simply won't be able to, and you won't want to either as everyone will be using it."

Hello,



So the whole situation is, I’m having a screen tearing issue. As you can see from my specs I have a decent rig, I’ve been having screen tearing issues ever since I reset my pc. I never used to have screen tearing issues and I know exactly how gsync works. Right now if I cap my FPS to 144 (my monitors refresh rate) I get even worse/ noticeable screen tearing. Like I said. I never used to have this issue, even with uncapped I didn’t get screen tearing. Now I just do. It’s so annoying I’ve been trying to figure it out the past week and I’m so tired of it. What bothers me is that knowing my pc used to be fine and now I’m having this issue. And please don’t tell me to cap my FPS to 138 or play with vsync or even tell me how gsync works because believe me guys, I already know. What kind of fixes the issue is putting vsync on in global settings but I never used to need to do that, right now that’s what I’ve done and for most of the games I’ve tested to see if I have screen tearing , I don’t apart from one game League of Legends. I just want to know or get advice on what could’ve possibly gone wrong or maybe I might be missing certain drivers or something like that, I am not a pc expert and I really need help troubleshooting this issue. What can i do to fix this. Sorry if I sound quite rude but I’m just tired and I want to find a solution to this. Is there a setting I should have on or something, I just need help guys as this is very frustrating. Again sorry if I sound rude.



Also I had a 1080 and recently upgraded to a 1080 ti, I was having this issue with my 1080 as well. (After I reset my pc)



also i should add im on windows 10 pro 1909"

1080p upscaled to 4k looks good to me at 6’ away on my 55”.  I could see how it might be distracting up close to a monitor.  1440p with “medium” + RTX high + DLSS is also possible but it dips under 60 here and there.

They support it now, there would be no reason for them to remove it in the future. Lots of companies buy mid range gaming cards for work stations as a cheap solution in some studios that do graphics. I use Adobe After Effects and Premier CC and they both utilize NVLInk. I also know that Maya 3D supports SLI/NVLink. I got good render times on the 2080's using the Studio Drivers from Nvidia last year. You can also use the game drivers as well but you won't get the performance you would get from the Studio driver or an actual beefy Quadro card with the ODE Quadro driver."

			During our research, we found that certain temporal artifacts can be used to infer details in an image. Imagine, an artifact we’d normally classify as a “bug,” actually being used to fill in lost image details. With this insight, we started working on a new AI research model that used these artifacts to recreate details that would otherwise be lost from the final frame.



This AI research model has made tremendous progress and produces very high image quality. However, we have work to do to optimize the model's performance before bringing it to a shipping game.



Leveraging this AI research, we developed a new image processing algorithm that approximated our AI research model and fit within our performance budget. This image processing approach to DLSS is integrated into Control, and it delivers up to 75% faster frame rates.

			Should have released it now or sooner rather than later.  August we might still be on lock down.  People would have bought now before or right at stay-at-home orders.  But this gets deep, GPU and consoles going to take a backseat to Food, Utilities, and gas.  Should have announced via online last month.  This might be one of the worst years to launch anything from Consoles to cars.  Priorities are going to change after this pandemic.  AMD either doesn't really have Big Navi ready to go or are also holding out stupidly for a ""better time"".  I think it is the first..  Big Navi is starting to sound a lot like Fury and Vega.

They likely couldn’t rush the release with manufacturing delays due to the pandemic. Unemployment rate in the US is now double digit percentage and headed towards great depression numbers, a new gpu would be an extreme luxury for many folks.

Hello,



So the whole situation is, I’m having a screen tearing issue. As you can see from my specs I have a decent rig, I’ve been having screen tearing issues ever since I reset my pc. I never used to have screen tearing issues and I know exactly how gsync works. Right now if I cap my FPS to 144 (my monitors refresh rate) I get even worse/ noticeable screen tearing. Like I said. I never used to have this issue, even with uncapped I didn’t get screen tearing. Now I just do. It’s so annoying I’ve been trying to figure it out the past week and I’m so tired of it. What bothers me is that knowing my pc used to be fine and now I’m having this issue. And please don’t tell me to cap my FPS to 138 or play with vsync or even tell me how gsync works because believe me guys, I already know. What kind of fixes the issue is putting vsync on in global settings but I never used to need to do that, right now that’s what I’ve done and for most of the games I’ve tested to see if I have screen tearing , I don’t apart from one game League of Legends. I just want to know or get advice on what could’ve possibly gone wrong or maybe I might be missing certain drivers or something like that, I am not a pc expert and I really need help troubleshooting this issue. What can i do to fix this. Sorry if I sound quite rude but I’m just tired and I want to find a solution to this. Is there a setting I should have on or something, I just need help guys as this is very frustrating. Again sorry if I sound rude.



Also I had a 1080 and recently upgraded to a 1080 ti, I was having this issue with my 1080 as well. (After I reset my pc)



also i should add im on windows 10 pro 1909

It's probably the other monitor that is causing issues.  The 24G2U isn't listed as G-SYNC Compatible.  Try disconnecting it and see if the issue goes away.  I know this isn't the answer you want, but at least try it so you can identify a possible cause."

Other than blind luck, if it's a situation where there isn't enough stock for for day 1 demand at retail price (which is very likely and to some extent encouraged,) most day 1 purchasers will be paying a premium (again, other than a small number  with that crazy f5 place an order fast luck) .

It won't help that some ebay sellers will look to buy up anything at a decent price.

Then there's the wait for 3rd party coolers and prices period which makes you question whether you should buy a launch card even if you could get one at a good price - all in all, I find the current setup with GPUs (on both sides) to be a total fluster cluck. While consoles also can have some launch shortages, the situation quickly resolves, but the 2080 ti remained hard to get the right card at the right price since day 1. You had to make it a hobby to hunt one down at a good price until a year+ after release, which is really crappy. This is why some competition from AMD would be great, I really hope all this Navi 31 stuff turns out to be true and incoming, and that they are able to dampen the sense that there's no other game in town but the Ampere A102 for high end performance (or whatever the 3080ti / 3090 is).



Apple solved this problem with the iPhone launches by letting you order even with quite a backlog through their website and you would typically get your phone in 2 weeks at MSRP (for the last 2-3 years at least). In fact, in the last few years you could typically get easily a 20%+ discount by black friday which is not too far from the sept. launch window.



I hope there's enough stock and that Nvidia has some plan to deal with demand and avoid price gouging, but I doubt it."

This is why I asked which 2080 Ti.  The ROG STRIX defaults to 'P' or ""Performance"" mode for the BIOS, which uses an aggressive fan curve to keep the GPU as cool as possible since heat is the number one thing that will affect performance.  Boost 3.0 works out to about 9 MHz for every 5 Celsius above 40 degrees.  'Q' or ""Quiet"" mode sets it to 0db mode, which will cause the fans to not spin at all until 60 Celsius and prevent the fans from spinning up above 30-40%.  The clock profile should be the same for both modes, but you will most likely see lower clock speed over time due to the thermal throttling built into Boost as mentioned before.  Watch your temperatures and switch back to 'P' mode if the card is getting hotter than 84 Celsius."

This is just a function of how sound on PCs works.  The program that played the sound can crash and the sound will keep playing, because the actual playing of sounds isn't part of what crashed.  The problem is that you're leaving a game running, apparently unattended, for many hours, and for whatever reason, it then crashes.

Seems to me 2080 Ti with an overclock is pretty close. I would imagine 3080 or 3080 Ti should be able to do 120fps easily.



Although on a VRR display I doubt you would be able to tell the difference between 100fps and 120fps in this game anyway.

Maybe if you don’t want all the eye candy.  I barely average 100fps with a 8700k at 5ghz and 2080ti @2000mhz at 2160 x 1440 with all (most) of the eye candy on."

			Not sure about AMD/freesync.  But check out blurbusters for the explanation on gsync vs. vsync vs. no vsync.  If you're having problems with stuttering it is likely a driver or monitor problem.  I've had drivers break gsync for a bit but for the vast majority of time it was been a terrific experience and probably the best tech of the past 5 years.

			Because once your hit the max refresh rate of your display (or to be more precise, exceed it) you can't sync the display & GPU in any way other than v-sync (and all the variations on the tech like fast-sync etc.). So if you cap below that limit, you never find yourself playing with v-sync in the first place and instead remain in VRR territory. Why don't GPU drivers automatically cap your FPS to avoid that in the first place? I am not entirely sure, perhaps because the frame limiters built in the games tend to be a very little bit ""faster"" so they'd rather leave us the option of choosing how to cap our frames.



The narrow VRR range on yours means you are also always going to be close to the limits of your display, so the frametime compensation that the v-sync option adds to g-sync is probably even more critical for you than it is on other displays that can do 120hz and beyond. Explained here. Here, I don't factually know if AMD does the same thing with their v-sync setting. Haven't owned AMD hardware in a long time and never got the chance to test it.



VRR turns your screen into a slave of the GPU. But screens can't display an unlimited number of frames per second, so if the GPU is faster you either have no sync at all (lagless but you have tearing & stuttering) or you have v-sync and some amount of lag because of the buffering.



But if you cap your frames, you don't exceed the monitor's capabilities anymore. Bingo, you can have VRR - smooth, lagless*, tearing free.



*the only lag difference vs ""v-sync off"" is the lack of tearing: when you allow tearing, part(s) of the screen can show information a bit earlier than the rest - pretty logical when you think about it. But that's a really tiny number (a fraction of a frame!) no one should worry about. Again, explanations.

			A $1,200 CPU is going to give you around 200 GFLOP/s single precision arithmetic performance.  A 2080 Ti gets around 13 TFLOP/s single precision.  I don't know what we're arguing about here.

Eh, the 6700K @ 4GHz quad-core has 512 GFLOPS FP32 (pre-security firmware patches), and modern $1000+ CPUs (depending on the core-counts) can net upwards of 2+ TFLOPS FP32 - this is peak/optimized performance on what the hardware itself is capable of, and still dependent of software optimizations to take full advantage of that.

Even the Jaguar in the PS4 @ 1.6GHz (8-cores) is capable of ~102 GFLOPS FP32, and that is slightly less powerful than a Haswell i3 dual-core @ 3GHz.

Agreed - I also see the card coming with the needed adapter if they do come out with this new 12pin connector on the high end Nvidia GPUs, so I also really don't see why all the fuss is being made.

			V-sync is NOT actually v-sync if you are within the g-sync range - it simply activates a function to compensate for occasional and sudden frametime spikes. Originally nvidia did not even allow us to mess around with the v-sync setting for that reason. Your issue is elsewhere. Or maybe you were just hitting your refresh rate limit (or maybe your games were not running at your maximum refresh rate, it can sadly still happen even with the ""prefer highest refresh rate"" option).



From what I recall they gave us the option to force v-sync off around when AMD released Freesync, because AMD's default setup let your framerate go out of the VRR range, which lets you tout slightly lower latency numbers (if you go higher than your refresh rate) with very high framerates, but nothing else. For some reason nvidia never bothered to explain or clarify the settings and people like those on blurbusters had to do the digging and write down the explanations. And the default g-sync setup nowadays (with a clean install) doesn't even have v-sync on anymore, so I can understand the confusion and why so many seem to get it wrong and complain about tearing with g-sync on. It kinda baffles me to be honest, nvidia could easily make a g-sync default setup that's good enough for 99.9% of users, if not more, especially with their new built-in frame limiter.

hm, I don't know.  it was really easy to test.  all I had to do was alt tab and turn vsync off and notice less input lag with BF5.  I never hit my fps limit in that game.  I avg about 90 fps with med settings at 1440p.  I have a second monitor, maybe it has something to do with that."

There are scaling issues with Alternate-frame Rendering in DX11.  And Explicit Multi-GPU is barely supported in DX12.

Until you have support for applications that can scale perfectly, you have no market for  GPU chiplets.





Nvidia/AMD tried to hack  their way into multil-GPU, but they eventually gave-up.  By the time you setup local memory for each chip, you might as well make a single die.  There is no cost savings splitting up GPU into multiple dies, unless you can figure out how to share the same memory (think console APUs).  Since high-performance GPUs are VERY LIMITED on memory bandwidth, we're not going that route for multiple GPUs anytime soon!



Nvidia DGX Supercomputer platforms are the closest you're going to get to that  (and they STILL use separate GPUS/ separate local memory on that!)"

However, not being able to buy that supply in advance because the requisite connector doesn't exist yet is pretty annoying.



AIBs have been doing 2X8 and even 3X8 for years now, and I'm willing to bet they will continue to do so even if Nvidia drops a new connector.



My hope is that it's not true or - as was suggested by one article I read - the connector will be an interface between the PCB and cooling solution, where the cooling solution will have normal 8-pin and / or 6-pin connectors on the exterior."

			Yeah the breakdowns are really interesting. Goes to show that there’s a lot happening each frame and performance is bound by different things depending on what type of work is being done.



I don’t know how accurate that visualization is but I was surprised to see such low memory bandwidth usage during the RT steps. Maybe the entire BVH structure fits in L2.



It’s probably just how the graph was drawn and the green RT section is blocking the memory graph.

I wouldn't expect the memory to be utilized much when the GPU is just crunching numbers.  You can see when the framebuffer updates and postprocessing happens that the memory gets hit really hard, which is where I would expect it to.  I didn't do a lot of shader work, and it was with SM 2.0, but I remember needing to try and simplify color calculations as much as possible to keep the memory from becoming more of a bottleneck than it already is.  Bandwidth is around 20x wider than it was back then, but we have added a hell of a lot more to the postprocessing part of the pipeline since then, too."
